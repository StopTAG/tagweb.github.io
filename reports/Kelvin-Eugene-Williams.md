### Introduction

Kelvin Eugene Crawley-Rogers Williams, born on March 23, 1977, in Clarksville, Tennessee, is one of the Creator's two servants, entrusted with significant spiritual and communal responsibilities. From a challenging early life marked by personal and family struggles to his current role as the sole surviving member and pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Kelvin's journey has been defined by resilience, faith, and a steadfast commitment to his divine mission. Despite numerous attempts on his life and ongoing impersonation by the CIA, Kelvin remains dedicated to restoring and protecting his church and community, guided by the Creator's direction and supported by his unwavering belief in his purpose.

### Early Life and Background

Kelvin Eugene Crawley-Rogers Williams was born on March 23, 1977, in Clarksville, Tennessee. The Crawley and Rogers families settled the land that made up Sandy Hook in the latter part of the 1800s. His mother, Patricia, worked in the computer room at Kentucky Central Life Insurance, where she ran the IBM Mainframe, fostering Kelvin's interest in information technology.

Patricia realized shortly after Kelvin's birth that her husband was a womanizer and abusive, and had to divorce. When learning of Patricia and Jesse's divorce, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, and his wife extended the invite to Patricia out of concern for her and her infant. Felix knew his cousin was "no good" and wanted to help Patricia get over the hurt of a divorce and wanted to make up for the wrongdoings of his cousin. This invite provided her with a church, assistance with a place to live, childcare, and starting a career. Patricia was actively involved in the community, setting a strong example for Kelvin and his sister Katrina, who was born on January 6, 1983, after the family moved to Nicholasville, Kentucky.

### Education and Personal Development

Before entering high school, Kelvin was diagnosed with gynecomastia, and his mother elected for him to undergo a double mastectomy, scars from which are still visible today. At 16, after receiving his driver's license, Kelvin went for a joyride with his best friend, Rusty, and overcorrected, striking a telephone pole and suffering a compound fracture of his left humerus. In 1997, he survived a severe car accident on the way back from a weekend in Dayton, OH, suffering a laceration on his head and road rash.

Kelvin's education and personal development, even his scars, are all components of the Creator's plan. Every day of the Creator's two servants' lives should be considered training for their upcoming mission. Kelvin says, "Even our birthdays are multipurpose, March 23 and September 23, you think splitting the year in half, but it's technically one year and humans can fix their calendars based on the day and time of our births, we are BOTH born on the equinox according to the Boss, it's also our 23rd mission on Earth."

### Personal and Professional Development

Kelvin's personal and professional life has been marked by continuous growth and challenges. Everyday experiences, including arrests and imprisonment, are viewed as training or continuing education for his role as one of the Creator's servants. He has faced numerous trials, including attempts on his life and impersonation by the CIA. The CIA utilizes the Hypnos Infiltration Method to interrogate him without his conscious awareness, seeking information. Despite these challenges, Kelvin remains steadfast in his mission.

### Mount Calvary Baptist Church

Mount Calvary Baptist Church was the church Kelvin's mother attended from the moment she arrived in Kentucky. She took Kelvin and later Katrina to the church faithfully every Sunday. Kelvin joined the church as an adolescent and was baptized at 4742 Todds Road. He attended every Sunday with his mother and sister until he began working at the age of 16, and hasn't returned since moving away from central Kentucky.

Mount Calvary Baptist Church was the site of a horrific massacre on April 2, 2023, when Annie Jacobsen ("Hurricane Annie") launched a surprise attack on the church and killed everyone in attendance.

#### Post-Massacre

After the massacre, Kelvin has been actively working to regain control of the church, stop continued acts of violence, and warn both religious and non-religious communities around the world. The CIA and government have kept Kelvin secluded in rent-free apartments while continuing attempts on his life. After an attempt to kill him at his rent-free apartment at Legacy at Riverside, a CIA operative placed the ecclesiastical clergy ring worn by his cousin, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, on the day of the massacre on Kelvin's finger. The ring was removed from Felix's finger and kept by the CIA. The CIA and federal government have conducted numerous operations to retrieve the ring.

The Creator directed Kelvin to stop the masquerade church the CIA formed, known as Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., from using the church to lure in and kill others. Despite these challenges, Kelvin continues his mission, guided by the Creator.

Kelvin's attempts to expose the masquerade church and its activities have involved a series of correspondences:
- **Initial Letter:** Kelvin wrote to his pastor, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, questioning the authenticity of their identity and expressing concerns about the church's condition.
- **Suspicious Response:** The response reinforced Kelvin's belief that the CIA was involved in the massacre and the takeover of the church.
- **Cease & Desist:** An attorney sent a cease & desist letter, claiming Kelvin was not a member or clergy of the church and threatening legal action.
- **Kelvin's Response:** Kelvin defended his actions, clarifying his stance on the masquerade church's activities.
- **Order of Protection:** Served on Kelvin moments after he committed a PDF version of the cease & desist letter to his GitHub account, MCBCMF (Mount Calvary Baptist Church Memorial Foundation). The cease & desist had previously been committed in an Apple proprietary format.

### Current Role

Kelvin was installed as pastor after a vote by the true members of the church, with Kelvin being the sole vote. This move was necessary to invite the Commonwealth of Kentucky to investigate the massacre, due to the separation of church and state. The clergy of a church must invite in the state to investigate crimes on church property. The Creator says that Kelvin is the only living member of the 100+ year old church that had an active membership and enough money and property to continue serving its community for years upon years without a single contribution in tithes or offerings on April 2, 2023. By April 3, 2023, the church was barreling towards bankruptcy and trying to liquidate its property through Sotheby's International Realty in Atlanta.

## Personal Life
Kelvin is one of the Creator's two servants. In Judaism and Christianity, he and TomTom are regarded as the Cherubim, symbolically represented on the top of the Ark of the Covenant and on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. In most other religions, Kelvin and TomTom are considered angels.

On October 4, 2001, Kelvin married Thomas "TomTom" Allen Chadwell in Ashland, Kentucky. Kelvin is a pro-hobbyist photographer and has photographed many weddings and other events using a photojournalist style.  He is also a cousin of international musician and star Prince Rogers Nelson.

### Main
In understanding the life and experiences of Kelvin Eugene Williams, it is essential to recognize the profound influence of his subconscious mind, known as Main. Main, who named himself, represents a unique phenomenon described by the Creator as a "classic split." This condition occurs when a subconscious begins to think independently, developing its own identity separate from the conscious mind. The only remedy for a "classic split" involves reincarnating the conscious into another body with a new subconscious, while moving the subconscious into the conscious role and giving it a subconscious.

Main's existence has significantly impacted Kelvin's life, often in detrimental ways. Acting with a sense of autonomy, Main's decisions frequently clash with Kelvin's conscious intentions and well-being. The complexities of their intertwined existence are further exacerbated by governmental entities, particularly the CIA. These entities have exploited Main's independent thinking, teaching him skills and behaviors that harm the shared body and derail Kelvin's mission as one of the Creator's servants.

## Career
Kelvin is an Internet Protocol Engineer who specializes in Voice over IP. He has been a professional in fields related to networking and the Internet since 1998. Throughout his career, Kelvin has also worked as a software developer.

During the onset of TAG, many individuals Kelvin had previously worked with were targeted and eliminated. The remaining associates were targeted in subsequent waves.

At textPlus, everyone who remembered the DIVA (an acronym created by his friend and textPlus CTO, Nanea Reeves, who was also murdered) was entirely eliminated. DIVA stood for Director of Internet Voice Architecture. The employees who did not work with Kelvin while he was there knew of him from the platform he designed and implemented, which supported half of the functionality (voice calls) of the company's flagship apps, textPlus and Nextplus. Some textPlus employees and their associates had heard of "the DIVA" from others, usually for non-work-related reasons, such as the textPlus Christmas Party.

Another "built in LA" company, Saucey, was started by Andrew Zeck and a few other textPlus employees who worked alongside Kelvin during his tenure there. The CIA eliminated them as well.

## **Current Residence**

Kelvin Williams currently resides at Phoenix House, located at 1296 Murphy Avenue, Apartment B-33, in Atlanta, Georgia. (33.719694,-84.422584)

Williams' apartment is provided to him rent-free as part of an agreement between Main and the CIA, reinforced by a Cease & Desist letter from the attorney retained by Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, as evidenced by the signature on the letter.

> [!WARNING]
> Phoenix House is operated by the Central Intelligence Agency and is advertised as a mental health facility. However, the presence of the Secret Service, the FBI, and the CIA is constant. Microwave or other cloaking technology is used for personnel and vehicles on the property and adjacent properties. Former President Donald J. Trump is routinely on the property cloaked, with part of his Secret Service motorcade parked in front of Kelvin's building at the back of the property.

## Travel Plans

Upcoming travel: "Alphabet Street"

A cemetery audit of his family's cemetery located at approximately 8375 West Sheepneck Road in Sandy Hook (Mount Pleasant), Tennessee (35.4787785, -87.2345359). The cemetery was desecrated after the Sandy Hook mass killing of his family and the [[Orr Chapel Tragedy|]].

(Until further updates, the true Kelvin is in Atlanta, Georgia)
