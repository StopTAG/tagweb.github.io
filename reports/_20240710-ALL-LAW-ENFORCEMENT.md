**Law Enforcement Bulletin: Advisory on PLANNED Mass-Killings**

**Date:** 2024-06-20
**Last Updated:** 2024-07-17

**Subject:** Advisory on Mass-Killing Operations at Previously Attacked Churches 

---

### Overview

Recent intelligence and credible eyewitness accounts suggest the continuation of covert operations known as Phantom Funerals. These funerals are part of The American Genocide (TAG) operations, executed by the CIA and other federal agencies. 

We are aware the perpetrators have begun advertising (via word of mouth campaigns) food pantries/giveaways to the general public wherein tbose who come to the churches are executed.

The purpose of these operations are to eliminate potential whistleblowers and maintain secrecy regarding TAG activities. The Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT) is frequently employed during these operations to ensure no local emergency response can intervene.

### Immediate Threat

**Hickory Valley Christian Church** is identified by our intelligence as the location of an imminent Phantom Funeral on Wednesday 2024-07-17.  Law enforcement should be on high alert for any suspicious activity in and around this area.

**Mount Zion Baptist Church** is identified by our intelligence as the location of an imminent Phantom Funeral on Wednesday 2024-07-17.  Law enforcement should be on high alert for any suspicious activity in and around this area.

Our intelligence suggests the sanctuary has been renovated and all killing is now occurring in the basement or other areas on the church's property. Victims are taken by force to the area after entering the sanctuary which is likely staged to appear as if a funeral is occurring.

### Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)

#### Overview

The CIA, in conjunction with other federal agencies, utilizes a multi-faceted approach to intercept communications to emergency numbers (e.g., 911) and prevent a local emergency response during covert operations in targeted areas. This involves sophisticated interception of mobile and landline communications and diversion from the Public Safety Answering Pointâ€™s (PSAP) established call handling and dispatching procedures, ensuring complete operational secrecy and manipulation of emergency responses.

#### Components

1. **Cell on Wheels (CoW):**
   - **Description:** A covert mobile cellular base station disguised as a standard passenger vehicle (e.g., Ford Explorer) with no visible antenna array.
   - **Function:** Redirects all mobile phone connections within a 0.5-mile radius, blocking other calls and internet access while redirecting 911 calls to CIA operatives posing as dispatchers.

2. **Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion:**
   - **Description:** A directive issued by a federal or state law enforcement agency, instructing PSAPs to refer emergency requests from targeted areas to the issuing agency.

3. **Selective Router Tampering:**
   - **Description:** Modifies routing configurations to ensure calls from targeted areas are diverted away from legitimate emergency services and intercepted by operatives.

### Observations and Warnings

Law enforcement agencies are advised to be vigilant of the following:

1. **Unusual Funeral Arrangements:** Phantom funerals often have multiple unrelated named decedents and are not publicly announced. Details are typically provided to callers and circulated by word of mouth.
2. **Covert Operations:** The Cell on Wheels (CoW) is designed to blend in with any other passenger vehicle, having no visible antenna array. It may appear to be an undercover law enforcement vehicle.
3. **Communication Interruption:** The CoW has a range of up to 0.5 miles, blocking all other calls and internet access. Calls to 911 are redirected to CIA operatives. **Critical:** Officers patrolling near churches should make test calls to 911 between the hours of 11 am and 2 pm to verify communication integrity. DO NOT USE A DEPARTMENT ISSUED PHONE, an old phone with no service or random stranger's phone is best. Make sure the officer speaks to someone preferably they know, and request some kind of radio traffic to ensure the entire loop is in tact.
4. **Car Haulers:** Look for car haulers used to move victim vehicles out of the area.
5. **Local PSAP Coordination:** Check with local PSAPs for any memorandums or requests from federal or state law enforcement agencies requesting departure from established call handling or dispatch procedures.
6. **Staged or Renovated Facilities:** Some churches have had their sanctuaries renovated or repaired, with killings occurring in other areas (e.g., basements and gymnasiums) to obscure activities.
