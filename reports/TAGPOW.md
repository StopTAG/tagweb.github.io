---

The TAG-POW (The American Genocide - Place of Worship) attacks represent a series of meticulously executed assaults on various places of worship. Each attack has displayed tactics described in "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen's book *"Surprise, Kill, Vanish."* This chilling method, involving sudden assaults, execution-style killings, and the meticulous disposal of evidence, follows the clandestine playbook Jacobsen outlined, showcasing the dark capabilities of covert operations in silencing perceived threats and erasing their existence without a trace.

### Additional Tactics Utilized

1. **[[Phantom Remains|]]**: Employing various illegal body disposal methods to ensure no trace of the victims is left behind, making it difficult to investigate or confirm deaths.
2. **[[Phantom Vehicles|]]**: Removing and making victim vehicles untraceable by selling them or giving them away, effectively erasing any evidence linking the vehicles to the crime scenes.
3. **[[Phantom Identity Scheme|]]**: A complex identity theft operation that creates the illusion that victims are still alive, obscuring their deaths and complicating investigations.
4. **Faux Religious Services**: Conducting fake religious services to maintain the appearance of normalcy and cover up the attacks.
5. **Hosted Community Events**: Organizing community events to distract from the incidents and create a facade of peaceful activity.
6. **Membership Targeting**: Systematically identifying and targeting members of the congregation to eliminate witnesses and potential threats.
7. **[[Phantom Funeral|]]**: Holding sham funerals to mislead communities and authorities about the fate of victims and eliminate a victim's network of associates. Every mourner attending a phantom funeral is killed.
