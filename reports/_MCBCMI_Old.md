# Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.
It was announced in a way that I've never seen any church celebration done before at the true Mount Calvary Baptist Church along Todds Road in Lexington, KY, my lifelong church. Normally, they're added to the church announcements which my mother used to read each Sunday morning. The 40th Pastoral Anniversary at the new Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. had professional photographers and  graphic artists producing the advertisement and social media gurus circulating them online.

They want you to believe that quite a few of my family gathered at Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. and we all did our part to celebrate the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III’s 40th Pastoral Anniversary.

The event was the biggest, most advertised, event since the massacre at the true Mount Calvary Baptist Church which held worship services for over 100 years at the same curve on Todds Road.  Advertisements for the event on social media even showed Mount Calvary hosting a visiting church and guest speaker. The problem is the visiting church and guest speaker were both charades and according to the Creator, and have never even held a worship service.

The whole anniversary celebration was just every shade of wrong. I was at home at the CIA-kill facility, Legacy at Riverdale, in Riverdale, GA when a man who resembles the younger, much heavier me, stepped to the podium. The man resembled what most in central Kentucky remember when they think of me. At the same time, I was right here in Riverdale, completing what I considered to be an odd task for the Creator: taking a selfie with something showing the time and date (ignore the CIA minder in the background). 

You see, the 40th Pastoral Anniversary was all a photoshoot by and for the CIA, intended to be used as a tool to welcome outsiders in. It is important to note, the event wasn’t even done on a Sunday. Sundays are workdays for the new company-church, a day set aside to kill any unsuspecting worshippers who venture onto Mount Calvary Baptist Church’s property.

Everything you see from the new Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. or “company-church” is planned, rehearsed, staged and photographed — sometimes with professional photographers. If you noticed an odd name for a church, it’s theirs. I first seen it when I wrote my church after I was told of the massacre, and the new company-church responded.

The wrong doesn’t end there, they have what is sold to viewers as my mother, my niece, and my sister in the choir stand, all giving their staged smiles and looks of approval of what’s supposed to be my cousin, the pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III.

My mother would have told you that she "couldn’t carry a tune in a five gallon bucket." I believe she did try out for the choir once, I think they encouraged her to serve the Lord in other way, she became an usher instead. So for her to be sitting in the choir stand was the first thing I noticed as just plain wrong.

The only photos I have of my mother, Patricia Rogers Crawley Williams, and my  sister, Katrina Renee Duvall Torain, along with her daughters, Kennedy and Karrington, were sent to me by the CIA to appease me when I was concerned for their safety and they wouldn't have a video call with me. The photos show them seated at Connor's Steak and Seafood in Huntsville, AL with CIA personnel seated behind my sister and niece. My family never left the restaurant that day, the CIA uses high-value gift certificates and a delectable menu to entice unknowing innocent people to make a reservation for private dining where they are only murdered without being served water. 

My sister a State of Alabama Probation and Parole officer based in Decatur was nearly almost always armed, and my mother wasn't a stranger to carrying a pistol on her person either.  Connor's Steak & Seafood conveniently for the CIA's killers has a no firearms policy clearly posted.

They featured the woman who slightly resembles my mother as she presented an award to the individuals who have been hired to be the slain Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III and his wife. I know it wasn't my mother the CIA murdered her and my sister in 2022. 

A woman who they hired to be my aunt Emma Jean Dale of Elizabethtown was seen alongside the woman pretending to be my sister, Katrina. They appear to be presenting another award of some kind. The problem with this is two-fold, first my aunt doesn't attend church ever. I only recall her being in church for my grandmother's funeral and it wasn't at Mount Calvary. The other problem is, with as much reported family participation, there's no room for anyone else to even be associated with the church. But wait, I don't think they realize which family they should showcase at this charade. They've focused on my mother and her siblings, but it's my father's family that are of the Williams variety.
