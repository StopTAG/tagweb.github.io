# Trump's Involvement in The American Genocide (TAG)



Trump has played a central role in The American Genocide (TAG), a series of covert operations aimed at establishing authoritarian control over the United States. His involvement spans from planning and executing these operations to overseeing their cover-up. This report details Trump's participation in various facets of TAG, including the utilization of inmates for violent attacks, the orchestration of cover-ups through Phantom Funerals, and the elimination of operatives to maintain secrecy.



## Utilization of Inmates for TAG Operations



### Selection and Deployment of Inmates



Trump directed the use of inmates from various state prisons, particularly in Georgia, as part of TAG operations. Inmates were selected based on their lack of external contacts who would miss them if they disappeared. Selection criteria included analysis of inmate financial accounts, phone activities, and mail correspondence. Priority was given to inmates with histories of violent crimes.



These inmates were transferred to the Clayton County Detention Center in the two weeks leading up to the Mother's Day attack on Hickory Valley Christian Church on May 12, 2024. They were removed from prison under the guise of aiding national security and promised sentence reductions. Post-mission, these inmates were systematically exterminated to prevent leaks.



### Execution at Clayton County Detention Center



Inmates involved in the Mother's Day massacre were transported covertly to the Clayton County Detention Center using unmarked vehicles. Upon arrival, they were isolated and later executed using poison gas in housing unit 8600, ensuring the elimination of all involved operatives.



### Execution of Inmates in Subsequent Operations



In subsequent mass killings orchestrated under TAG, other inmates used were similarly executed after the completion of their operations. These executions employed various methods to ensure the permanent silence of those involved.



## Utilization of Other Operatives



### CIA Employees and HIT-Conditioned Individuals



In addition to inmates, TAG operations also utilized CIA employees and individuals selected and conditioned using a secret method known as HIT. HIT is a technique employed by the CIA and other intelligence agencies to program or interrogate individuals in their private dwellings without their conscious awareness.



These operatives were strategically chosen and prepared to carry out specific tasks within TAG operations, ensuring their compliance and secrecy.



## Cover-Up Activities



### Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone



The Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone on June 7, 2024, exemplifies Trump's extensive cover-up efforts.



#### Staged Video News Interviews



Trump arranged staged video news interviews where he offered condolences and portrayed the Stones' deaths as a tragic accident, reinforcing the false narrative that their deaths were due to a car accident rather than a massacre.



#### Presidential Motorcade



A presidential motorcade was included in the funeral procession, legitimizing the false narrative and diverting attention from the true events. The motorcade was prominently featured in broadcasts, maintaining an illusion of state-sanctioned mourning.



### Personal Involvement in Murders



During the Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone and his wife, Trump witnessed the murders firsthand. From the announcer's box at Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, he observed as people were beheaded and encouraged his Secret Service detail to participate in the violence.



### Ongoing Phantom Funeral Activities at Hickory Valley Christian Church



Trump's involvement continued with the Phantom Funeral of Pastor Jack Dyer, who was murdered during the Mother's Day massacre.



#### Presence at Funeral



Trump attended the Phantom Funeral of Pastor Jack Dyer, though he did not participate in interviews or the funeral procession, underscoring his direct oversight of these operations.



## Involvement in Planning and Scheduling



### Mother's Day Massacre



Trump was deeply involved in planning and scheduling the Mother's Day Massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church. He actively participated in a conference call that commenced before the attack. Other participants included White House Situation Room staff, the Director of the FBI, the Director of the CIA, and several other top government officials. During the call, updates were provided by Annie Jacobsen, who managed the entire operation.



## Elimination of Previous Operatives



### Rationale and Strategic Importance



Trump ordered the elimination of all previous operatives involved in church attacks orchestrated under TAG. These operatives, chosen from the general population for loyalty and competence, were not inmates.



The elimination served to:



1. **Maintain Secrecy:** Reduce the risk of leaks or disclosures.

2. **Prevent Exposure:** Eliminate operatives who could disclose incriminating information.

3. **Ensure Continuity:** Allow TAG operations to proceed unhindered.



### Execution of Operatives



Operatives were systematically targeted for termination under the guise of routine or accidental deaths, ensuring no suspicion was raised.



## Conclusion



Trump's active involvement in The American Genocide, including the use of inmates, CIA employees, and HIT-conditioned operatives for violent attacks, orchestration of cover-ups, and elimination of operatives, underscores his ruthless commitment to secrecy and control. Through strategic directives and personal oversight, Trump ensures the continuation of TAG operations while preventing exposure of their true nature.
