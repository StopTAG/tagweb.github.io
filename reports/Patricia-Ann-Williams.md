#### Early Life and Family Background
Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, affectionately known as Pat, was born on September 26, 1950, in Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, to Lila Elizabeth Crawley (Richardson) and Josie Rogers. Her parents were neighbors but never married. Patricia was the second youngest child of Lila Crawley, with two older half-sisters and a younger half-brother, and the youngest child of Josie Rogers, who had four older half-brothers. Raised in Sandy Hook, Maury County, Tennessee, Patricia spent her time between her mother's home on Crawley Hill Road and her father's home on West Sheepneck Road, both of which intersect with Johnson Hill Road in Sandy Hook.

Patricia was murdered in the first week of October 2022 by the CIA.

#### Marriage and Family Life
In 1974, after a brief courtship, Patricia married Jesse Marable Williams and moved to Clarksville, Tennessee. Their union, however, was short-lived. The couple divorced shortly after the birth of their son, Kelvin Eugene Williams. Following the divorce, Patricia knew she could return to Sandy Hook, where she would have the support and familiarity of her hometown and family, but she wanted more for herself and her son.

#### Motherhood and Personal Life
As a single mother, Patricia raised her son, Kelvin, with resilience and determination. Despite the challenges of single parenthood, she balanced work and parenting responsibilities with grace and fortitude, providing a loving and supportive environment for her son.

Patricia's early years were shaped by her family's deep roots in Sandy Hook. Her conception was immortalized in the song "Raspberry Beret" by her cousin, Prince Rogers Nelson, which retells the story of her parents' casual sexual encounter. The song references "old man Johnson's farm," a real location on Johnson Hill Road in Sandy Hook, adding a touch of musical legacy to Patricia's life story.

#### Move to Kentucky
After divorcing Jesse Williams, Patricia faced the challenge of starting anew. She moved to Lexington, Kentucky, with the support of Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, her ex-husband's cousin. This move was a turning point for Patricia, providing her with a fresh start and a supportive community at [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]]. Patricia quickly integrated into the community, finding a job with the help of Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, and forming lasting friendships.

#### Community and Service
Patricia was deeply committed to her church and community. She was an active member of [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]], attending services regularly and participating in church activities. Her dedication to her faith and community was unwavering, even as she balanced her responsibilities as a single mother.

#### Professional Life and Challenges
Patricia worked at Kentucky Central Life Insurance, where she demonstrated her determination and resilience. Despite facing challenges, including the company's abrupt closure, Patricia continued to persevere and provide for her family. Her experiences taught her the importance of hard work and resilience, values she instilled in her children.

#### Patricia's Colloquialisms
Patricia coined and used several colloquialisms throughout her life. One notable phrase, "half-assed," originated from the birth of her daughter, Katrina Renee Duvall-Torrain. During Katrina's delivery, Patricia was rushed into the delivery room as her contractions were very close, and she began pushing. However, the young doctor, upon looking into the birth canal, screamed, "STOP!" because he could see half of Katrina's buttocks. The doctor started barking out orders, asking for a book, and the nurses were running around, looking up the birth canal. My mother was confused and scared by the chaos around her. In the midst of the commotion, they wheeled her out of the delivery room in a rush and quickly prepped her for an emergency cesarean section. A few minutes later, Katrina was safely delivered by C-section.

From that point forward, "half-assed" for Patricia meant anything completed incorrectly or not thoroughly. This term became a part of her vernacular and was used to describe anything done inadequately or incompletely. Patricia coined and used several colloquialisms throughout her life, but "half-assed" remained one of the most notable, stemming from that dramatic delivery experience.

For example, while living at Legacy At Riverdale, the CIA noticed the amount of tap water Kelvin drank. He often tells people, "I'm not fancy." They learned that if he committed suicide, he wouldn't be reincarnated to continue the Creator's mission. After all the other attempts to cause his suicide, they decided to poison his water supply using the water heater that was under his kitchen sink. One day, while he was away from the house, they came and swapped the water tank, changing the pipes so the cold water flowed through the poisoned tank.

Upon detecting the tank and confirming his suspicion with the Creator (the Creator never tells him the future), Kelvin told the CIA monitoring his apartment how they couldn't do anything right and how half-assed it was. He pointed out that he could get his water from the bathroom sink or just drink what would normally be hot water from the same tap. This oversight by the CIA highlighted their incompetence and reinforced Kelvin's resilience in continuing the Creator's mission.

#### Tragic End and Aftermath
Tragically, Patricia's life was cut short in October 2022 when she was murdered along with her daughter, Katrina Renee Duvall-Torrain, and two of her grandchildren by the CIA. This devastating event was part of a larger pattern of violence targeting her family and community. The CIA has been reported to impersonate Patricia in photos and videos from [[Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.|_MCMBCI]], a masquerade church formed after the massacre of the actual [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] on Todds Road in Lexington, Kentucky.

#### Legacy and Spiritual Role
Patricia's son, Kelvin Eugene Williams, describes her as a crucial figure in the Creator's plan, serving as a primary mother for one of the Creator's servants. Her life and legacy extend beyond her immediate family, touching on broader spiritual and existential themes. Kelvin, who identifies as one of two servants of the Creator, emphasizes the significant spiritual role his mother played in his life and the lives of others.

#### Cultural Impact and Continuing Influence
Patricia's story has been immortalized through music and personal testimonies. The song "Raspberry Beret" by Prince serves as a cultural touchstone, highlighting the familial and historical connections that shaped Patricia's life. Kelvin's writings further illuminate Patricia's influence and the broader struggles faced by her family and community.

#### Conclusion
Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams lived a life marked by love, service, and faith. Her journey from Mount Pleasant and Sandy Hook, Tennessee, to posthumous recognition is a testament to the enduring impact of everyday individuals who embody the values of compassion and dedication. Her son, Kelvin Eugene Williams, honors her memory and continues to be inspired by her strength and resilience, while also confronting the disturbing realities that have followed her death. Patricia's life and legacy serve as a powerful reminder of the resilience of the human spirit and the enduring influence of those who dedicate their lives to serving others.

[^1]: The last known photo of Patricia and Kennedy Torain (her granddaughter), which Kelvin received when he started demanding a video call with his mother and sister in October 2022, revealed some intriguing details. Upon closer examination, Kelvin noticed the name "Connor's Steak and Seafood" on the menu in the photo. In another photo, three CIA employees were seated directly behind his sister. Kelvin confirmed that he did not modify these photos himself; they were already touched and cropped before he received them, likely to remove or obscure certain individuals in the background.
