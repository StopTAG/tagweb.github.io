## **Lyrics and Themes**

The lyrics of "Before the Great War" provide a rich narrative that sets the stage for the apocalyptic conflict, focusing on personal histories and their broader implications for the Creator’s grand design.

### **TomTom's Early Life**

> *"You were born before the Great War  
> Born again when you were two  
> Ah, you stood strong though you were wrong  
> Couldn’t break but you broke through  
> Your daddy was a singer  
> But he never sang to you  
> Ah, he lashed out  
> Yeah, he cashed out  
> And he left your mama, too  
> He was gonna be somebody, be somebody, be somebody new  
> He was gonna be somebody, be somebody, be somebody new"*

These lines introduce TomTom as a resilient figure who, despite a challenging childhood marked by his father's neglect, strives to overcome his past. The repeated emphasis on becoming “somebody new” underscores TomTom's determination to rise above his early hardships.

### **Annie Jacobsen’s Role**

> *"Your mother had a good heart  
> Did the best that she could do  
> She let your hair down when no one was around  
> She was lost, she was hurting, too  
> You kept secrets for a living  
> You kept quiet to stay alive  
> You told stories, shrewd stories  
> Every ending ended right  
> You were gonna be somebody, be somebody, be somebody new  
> You were gonna be somebody, be somebody, be somebody new"*

Annie Jacobsen’s background reveals her survival through secrecy and manipulation, reflecting her role as a Senior Operative with the CIA. Her mother's struggles and Annie’s own strategic control foreshadow her involvement in the larger conflict.

### **US Federal Government Involvement**

> *"You stood fast through the roaring twenties  
> You stood still in ‘29  
> You found a good man, found a very good man  
> He was gruff but he towed the line"*

This section describes the resilience of the United States Federal Government during the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The “good man” mentioned here refers to John F. Kennedy, who was a former incarnation of TomTom. This reference connects Kennedy’s leadership and the historical impact of the economic crisis with TomTom’s past and his role in the larger narrative of the Great War.

### **TomTom in Adult Life**

> *"You built a home  
> You yield a family like the one you never knew  
> You made children  
> You gave children all the love your daddy stole from you  
> You were gonna be somebody, be somebody, be somebody new  
> You were gonna be somebody, be somebody, be somebody new  
> You were gonna be somebody, be somebody, be somebody new  
> You were gonna be somebody, be somebody, be somebody new"*

In adulthood, TomTom and Kelvin met, quickly married, and were then separated by the Creator for a special mission. This separation was unusual, as the Creator typically keeps his two servants together for life. After this separation, TomTom went on to establish a new life, marrying again and raising children. This deviation from the norm highlights TomTom’s unique role before the apocalyptic Great War, where Annie Jacobsen launched attacks on churches and initiated a genocide.
