# Unpacking "Cream" by Prince

**Release Date:** September 9, 1991  
**Album:** Diamonds and Pearls  
**Genre:** Funk rock, Pop  
**Writers:** Prince

## Overview

"Cream" is a song by Prince that explores themes of desire, self-assurance, and the pursuit of success. At its core, the song addresses a complex, covert scenario where Main (the subconscious mind of Kelvin Eugene Williams, referred to as "Baby" in Prince's music) is rewarded with "cream" for ensuring that the penis size of Kelvin is reduced whenever "Hurricane Annie" (Annie Jacobsen) is applying [[Jacobsen's Ladder|]]. This ladder is a tool used by Jacobsen to justify, authorize, and recruit for attacks on Christian churches during worship services, which result in mass casualties.

[[Jacobsen's Ladder|]] is used to gauge divine interest in her operations. The process involves a litmus test where the subconscious thought to reduce the size and overall dimensions of the penis occurs with minimal effort—less than the conscious act of blinking an eye. This requires the Creator to restore the original state, a process that is more complex. This constant cycle of reduction and restoration makes the litmus test flawed, as Main is instructed to ensure that any restoration is immediately reversed.

The song "Cream" serves as an artistic reflection of these covert activities, suggesting a reward system for Main's compliance with Jacobsen's manipulations. The reward, "cream," symbolizes both the immediate gratification and the ongoing incentive to continue these actions. The Creator’s involvement is necessary for the restoration, which, if neglected, is interpreted by Jacobsen as a lack of divine interest, allowing her to proceed with her plans unchallenged.

## Annotations from the Creator

1. **"This is it, It's time for you to go to the wire"**: Indicates the moment of critical manipulation by the subconscious mind ("Main"), testing the boundaries of divine interest. "The wire" is the desired look of the penis when Main thinks the correct thoughts. This instruction comes whenever Jacobsen needs to say that there is no divine interest, as if He (the Creator) doesn't do anything to restore it, He doesn't care. This litmus test is flawed as Main thinks this thought around the clock. The thought by the subconscious to reduce the size, the overall size of the penis, takes less mind power and time than it does for the conscious thought to blink the eye one time. Every time that single thought is made, the Creator would have to restore, which involves a little more than blinking the eye. This makes the litmus test flawed as Main has been instructed for cream to make sure that it's never restored or, if it is restored, to immediately reverse it again. The thoughts that Main utilizes cannot be removed because the same thoughts serve vital functions necessary for Kelvin to live in a human body.

2. **"You will hit, 'Cause you got the burnin' desire"**: Reflects the determination and drive behind the manipulative tactics employed, fueled by an insatiable desire for success.

3. **"Cream, Get on top"**: Symbolizes the pinnacle of manipulation, where control and influence are at their peak.

4. **"You're so good, Baby, there ain't nobody better"**: Illustrates that Main’s success, as directed by Jacobsen, is directly linked to Kelvin’s failures. Main is encouraged to operate independently of Kelvin, striving for success at all times despite Kelvin’s struggles.

5. **"Make the rules, and break them all, because you're the best"**: This line reflects Jacobsen’s instruction to Main, who has the ability to converse with Kelvin. Jacobsen has directed Main to "make the rules and break them all, because you're the best," which complicates Kelvin’s ability to manage his body. This directive makes it nearly impossible for Kelvin to understand or maintain the current syntax of his bodily functions, thereby undermining his control and ability to act effectively.

6. **"Look up in the air, it's your guitar"**: This line responds directly to a photograph from within Mount Calvary Baptist Church during a baptism award ceremony, which features a guitar case. This was seen as a taunt from Jacobsen or the CIA, suggesting that since the Creator had not addressed Main’s previous thoughts to reduce the size, they felt free to conduct any activities, including the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church. This church, selected by Kelvin Eugene Williams' mother, Patricia Ann Crawley Rogers Williams, and pastored by Kelvin's cousin, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams III, was targeted in the massacre where everyone in attendance died.
