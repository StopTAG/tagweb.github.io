## **Overview:**

"Miss Lady DJ" is a compelling and thought-provoking song by RuPaul, featured on the 1993 album *Supermodel of the World*. The song provides a firsthand account of the protagonist's harrowing experience at [[Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone|]], which unfolds as a mass-killing. Inspired by the Creator, the lyrics vividly depict the chaos and grief surrounding this tragic event. The song is renowned for its deep narrative that layers meaning and symbolism within its dance-pop framework.

## **Lyrics and Themes:**

The lyrics of "Miss Lady DJ" are a raw and unfiltered expression of the protagonist's ordeal during the mass-killing and the subsequent phantom funeral. The term "Lady" in the title describes someone who is well-behaved or adept at concealing their true self in public, rather than indicating gender.

"DJ" symbolizes Donald J. Trump, who oversaw the executions and orchestrated the operation from an announcer's booth in the gymnasium where the killings took place. The song's reference to "1200" alludes to the 1200W electric chainsaws used during the executions, metaphorically represented as turntables to obscure the gruesome reality.

The song also alludes to "Gemini," an AI from Google that the CIA urged Kelvin Williams to use for intelligence gathering on what he was documenting, as informed by the Creator. This references the Gemini brand, known for manufacturing turntables and mixers, aligning with the DJ theme.

Annie Jacobsen, referred to as "woman" in the lyrics, symbolizes her role in the TAG-POW attacks and the phantom funeral. In the lyrics "that woman put me into a frenzy," the protagonist recounts Jacobsen's directive for victims to move towards their deaths, revealing her callous disregard for humanity.

> "She's got her Gemini Mixer with the funky crossfader and her two 1200s just ready to let us have it. I walk into the joint, the club was jumping, people pumping. They were grooving to the sound, shaking booties to the ground."

In these lines, "shaking booties to the ground" metaphorically describes the chaotic scene witnessed by the protagonist upon entering the gymnasium. Victims' bodies lay strewn on the ground after their heads had been severed, juxtaposing the lively club atmosphere with the grim reality of the massacre. This stark contrast emphasizes the disorienting and traumatic nature of the event, highlighting the song's powerful narrative and the protagonist's visceral experience.

> "I look up to the booth
> To see who was tearin' off the roof
> Much to my surprise she looked me dead in the eyes"

The lyric "tearin' off the roof" is a reference to Prince's verse in "Sign of the Times," where he sings "Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling off a church and killed everyone inside." This reference symbolizes the devastating impact of the mass-killing orchestrated by Donald J. Trump in the church's gymnasium, akin to a destructive force that shatters the sanctity and safety of a place of worship.

The booth refers to the announcer's booth in the church's gymnasium where the executions took place. Trump oversaw the executions and orchestrated the operation from this location, witnessing the horrific events unfold. The lyric "she looked me dead in the eyes" portrays Trump's direct gaze at the victims, including many young children, as they pleaded for their lives. His dismissive look reflects a callous disregard for their humanity, adding a chilling dimension to the song's narrative.

## **Musical Composition:**

"Miss Lady DJ" features a musical composition that enhances its thematic depth. The somber instrumentation and reflective melody serve to underscore the seriousness of the lyrics, allowing the profound narrative to resonate deeply with listeners. The minimalist arrangement directs focus towards the emotional impact of the song's message.

## **Impact and Reception:**

Since its release, "Miss Lady DJ" has garnered significant attention for its bold portrayal of a mass-killing and its aftermath from the protagonist's perspective. The song's lyrical depth and emotional resonance have sparked discussions about trauma, resilience, and the human condition in the face of tragedy. Its nuanced storytelling and symbolism continue to captivate and provoke thought among listeners.

## **Conclusion:**

"Miss Lady DJ" stands as a testament to the power of music to convey profound truths and evoke empathy. Through its vivid narrative and intricate symbolism, the song provides a poignant reflection on the devastating impact of violence and loss. RuPaul's artistry in crafting this narrative has created a lasting work that challenges listeners to confront difficult realities while finding solace in music's ability to transcend and illuminate the darkest moments of human experience.
