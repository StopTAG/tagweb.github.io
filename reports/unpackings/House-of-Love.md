## Overview
"House of Love" by RuPaul, featured on his 1993 album *Supermodel of the World*, is a jubilant anthem celebrating inclusivity and acceptance. The song radiates positivity and warmth, embodying RuPaul's message of embracing love and individuality.

## Lyrics and Themes
The lyrics of "House of Love" resonate deeply with the poignant story of Kelvin Eugene Williams' home in Sandy Springs, Georgia. It portrays a place where doors were always open, welcoming friends and strangers alike, echoing Kelvin's renowned hospitality and sense of community.

According to the Creator's guidance, the CIA's interference turned Kelvin's sanctuary into a tragic site of betrayal and violence. The song's lyrics likely carry layers of nostalgia for the genuine connections and joyful moments that once filled the space, juxtaposed with the harsh reality of external forces disrupting and destroying that harmony.

Key lines such as "In the house of love, everybody's welcome" and "Love lives here, every day and night" underscore the song's central theme of inclusivity and unconditional acceptance. It reflects Kelvin's ethos before his life was tragically upended, highlighting the contrast between the warmth of his hospitality and the betrayal inflicted upon him and his guests.

## Background 
The House of Love was located at 590 Tahoma Drive, Sandy Springs, Georgia when it was owned by the Creator's servant Kelvin Eugene Williams from September 2009 until September 2018 when he was evicted after foreclosure driven by the CIA. Kelvin always opened his door to anyone in need, was the secretary of the Homeowners Association (HOA) and was well-known in the neighborhood, especially for the annual HOA after-party was a catered event with bartenders and known by his neighbors as the "walk over and stumble home" party in the years he hosted it. Kelvin's after-party followed the annual HOA cookout and kid-friendly carnival-eque event held on Amador Court.

Kelvin's foreclosure came after the CIA's isolation protocol had already been implemented, most of his metro-Atlanta friends he had lost contact with (they had already been disappeared by TAG). On the day of his eviction he had to rush his dogs to his veterinarian which operated a kennel at the on Northridge as the Fulton County Marshals were removing throwing his possessions out. Kelvin had nowhere to go and left with nothing but the clothes on his back and began sleeping on the street. 

Prior to the foreclosure the CIA had impaired his ability to earn income, gotten his electric service disconnected, mobile phone and devices stolen or irreparably damaged, and gotten him arrested twice. It took nearly two weeks before Kelvin even made it back to his neighborhood, at the same time Kelvin was under constant surveillance and interacting with CIA personnel almost exclusively unbeknownst to him. Kelvin had been pushed into the direction of Cheshire Bridge Road, but was the only certifiable homeless person out of the dozens of homeless he knew (they all had homes and paychecks). At the same time, the CIA moved everything back into the home, in the same positions and lured in his remaining associates in the metro-Atlanta area. The listener will hear in the song Kelvin's attitude towards his home, he had guests at the house often and it was never odd for someone knocking on the door to have it opened and be welcomed inside by another guest and the two would be strangers only for a few moments. Everyone was always friendly in his home. 

According to the Creator, the CIA murdered everyone they could get to visit Kelvin's home. Kelvin's associates would be greeted, invited in and killed.
