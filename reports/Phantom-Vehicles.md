# Phantom Vehicles 

Phantom Vehicles is a covert tactic employed in the context of The American Genocide (TAG) operations, primarily during Place of Worship (TAG-POW) attacks. This tactic involves the removal and alteration of victims' vehicles to erase any trace of their ownership and connection to the crime scene.

## Overview

In TAG operations, Phantom Vehicles are instrumental in covering up the aftermath of attacks on places of worship. By removing victims' vehicles from the crime scene, operatives aim to eliminate any evidence that could link them to the perpetrators or reveal the extent of the atrocities committed.

## Tactics and Methods

1. **Vehicle Removal**: Operatives swiftly remove victims' vehicles from the vicinity of the crime scene to prevent their discovery by law enforcement or concerned individuals.

2. **Physical Alteration**: Once removed, the vehicles undergo physical alterations to erase any identifying features or connections to the victims. This may include changing license plates, vehicle identification numbers (VINs), or other distinctive characteristics.

3. **Ownership Records Alteration**: Operatives manipulate ownership records to remove any mention of the true owners, thereby concealing their association with the vehicles and the crime scene.

4. **Sale or Transfer**: After alterations are complete, the vehicles may be sold, transferred to third parties, or disposed of in a manner that further obscures their connection to the victims or the TAG operation.

## Significance and Impact

Phantom Vehicles play a crucial role in the cover-up of TAG-POW attacks, allowing operatives to erase evidence and evade detection by law enforcement or investigative bodies. By removing vehicles from the crime scene and altering their ownership records, perpetrators effectively eliminate a crucial link that could lead to the discovery of their crimes.

## Historical Context

Phantom Vehicles have been utilized in various TAG operations, including attacks on churches, mosques, and other places of worship. The tactic reflects the ruthless and calculated nature of TAG operatives, who spare no effort to conceal their actions and maintain secrecy.

## Conclusion

Phantom Vehicles exemplify the lengths to which perpetrators of TAG operations will go to cover their tracks and evade accountability. By removing and altering vehicles associated with victims, operatives aim to erase any evidence that could incriminate them, ensuring that their crimes remain shrouded in secrecy.
