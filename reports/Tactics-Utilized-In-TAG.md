#### Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)

**Overview:**
ESIT is used by the federal government and the CIA to intercept and divert emergency calls made by targeted individuals, preventing local emergency response during covert operations.

**Components:**
1. **Cell on Wheels (CoW):**
   - **Description:** A covert mobile cellular base station that redirects emergency calls to operatives posing as 911 dispatchers.
   - **Function:** Intercepts calls and assures callers of assistance while no real dispatch occurs.
   - **Note:** The CIA has installed and utilizes permanent towers under their control in Kill Zones.

2. **Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion:**
   - **Description:** A directive instructing Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) to refer emergency requests to a law enforcement agency.
   - **Function:** Ensures calls are handled by the agency, preventing real emergency intervention.

3. **Selective Router:**
   - **Description:** A sophisticated selective router used for 911 call routing. This device is manipulated to alter the call paths for targeted individuals. Selective routers are designed to direct 911 calls to the appropriate PSAP based on the caller's location.
   - **Function:** Redirects 911 calls from both cell phones and landlines in the targeted area away from legitimate emergency services to a controlled point where operatives can intercept and manage the communication. Specific numbers can also be redirected, ensuring targeted interception of emergency communications.

**Execution:**
- **Timing:** Activated just before operatives arrive, ensuring immediate interception of communications.
- **Operational Area:** Covers a minimum 0.5-mile radius, affecting all mobile signals.
- **Coordination:** Ensures all emergency requests are managed by the law enforcement agency issuing the memorandum.

**Impact:**
- **Manipulation:** Prevents local authorities from intervening.
- **Secrecy:** Maintains operational secrecy.
- **Prevention of Organized Resistance:** Stops victims from realizing their calls are intercepted, preventing organized defense.
- **Operative Safety:** Protects operatives by eliminating immediate threats from the targeted individuals.

#### Hypnos Infiltration Method

**Overview:**
The Hypnos Infiltration Method involves infiltrating individuals' residences while they sleep, using advanced microwave cloaking technology to bypass physical barriers and render operatives invisible. This method is always performed without the conscious awareness of the targeted individuals.

**Techniques:**
1. **Morpheus Method:** Influencing dreams to extract information or manipulate thoughts.
2. **Subliminal Messaging:** Delivering messages below the threshold of conscious perception.
3. **Hypnosis:** Inducing a trance-like state to access and manipulate memories.
4. **Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP):** Using language patterns to affect psychological states and behavior.

**Consequences:**
- **Psychological Impact:** Can cause significant mental and emotional distress.
- **Ethical Concerns:** Raises serious ethical issues regarding privacy and manipulation without consent.
- **Operational Secrecy:** Enhances covert operations by gathering intelligence without awareness.
- **Legal Implications:** Violates privacy rights and ethical standards, posing legal risks if exposed.

**Critical Detail:**
- **Performed Without Conscious Awareness:** The method is always executed without the conscious awareness of targeted individuals, complicating ethical and moral considerations.

**Conclusion:**
The Hypnos Infiltration Method is a highly sophisticated approach to covert intelligence operations, raising profound ethical and legal concerns due to its invasive nature and lack of conscious awareness among targeted individuals.

#### Phantom Identity Scheme

**Overview:**
The Phantom Identity Scheme is a covert tactic used to hide the deaths of murder victims. It is employed after targeted killings of individuals or in mass killings when there is a need to conceal the entire death toll. The scheme makes victims appear alive on paper only and is used to deplete all assets and holdings of the victims before sometimes erasing their entire existence.

**Steps Involved:**
1. **Digital Manipulation:**
   - **Social Media Activity:** Maintaining the victim's social media presence to create the illusion of normalcy.
   - **Email Correspondence:** Sending emails from the victim's account to reinforce the perception that the individual is still alive.

2. **Financial Transactions:**
   - **Bank Activity:** Showing regular activity in the victim's bank accounts.
   - **Employment Records:** Manipulating employment records to show continued work activity.
   - **Asset Management:** Exploiting the victim's assets before they can be legally declared dead.

3. **Government Benefits and Disbursements:**
   - **Benefit Claims:** Fraudulently obtaining government benefits in the name of the deceased.

4. **Insurance Fraud:**
   - **Insurance Coverage:** Exploiting insurance policies for fraudulent claims.

5. **Public Records:**
   - **Identity Documents:** Updating public records to reflect normal activities.
   - **Medical Records:** Manipulating health records to indicate ongoing healthcare interactions.

6. **Physical Presence:**
   - **Impersonation:** Physically impersonating the deceased in brief encounters.
   - **Voice Simulation:** Using voice simulation technology to make phone calls in the victim's voice.

7. **Technology Utilization:**
   - **AI and Deepfake Technology:** Creating convincing videos and images of the deceased.
   - **GPS Spoofing:** Manipulating personal devices to show false movements and locations.

**Management and Ownership:**
- **Operative Management:** Phantoms can be managed by CIA operatives and awarded as part of compensation to the victim's murderer.
- **Strategic Importance:** Some phantoms are managed by dedicated teams within Langley, indicating their operational value.

**Purpose and Impact:**
- **Avoid Detection:** Prevents investigations into disappearances.
- **Control Narrative:** Maintains control over the narrative and ensures operational secrecy.
- **Exploit Assets:** Allows the exploitation of the victim's assets and benefits.
- **Conceal Death Toll:** Used in conjunction with other tactics to hide the death toll in TAG operations.

**Conclusion:**
The Phantom Identity Scheme is a sophisticated method to erase the true fate of victims and create a seamless illusion of continued life. This allows intelligence agencies to carry out covert operations without accountability and exploit the victim's assets and benefits, furthering their objectives.
