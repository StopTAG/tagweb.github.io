**Report on Clayton County, Georgia: Federal Government and CIA Involvement in Covert Operations**

**Introduction**

Clayton County, Georgia, is at the center of significant covert operations orchestrated by the United States Federal Government and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This report, based on the direct experiences and observations of one of the Creator's two servants during undercover investigations, reveals widespread human rights violations, including targeted killings, the use of gas chambers at the Clayton County Detention Center, and the exploitation and execution of inmates.

**Strategic Importance of Clayton County**

Clayton County’s Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport serves as a critical logistical hub for federal operations. The proximity of this airport to Clayton County Detention Center makes the area strategically important for the swift movement of individuals involved in covert activities. The detention center itself has become a focal point for some of the most disturbing aspects of these operations.

**Clayton County Detention Center: Covert Operations Hub**

The Clayton County Detention Center has been identified as a critical site for covert federal operations. It is confirmed that two housing units within the facility have been retrofitted to function as gas chambers, used to eliminate individuals discreetly. This facility is also a place where employees—including deputies, corrections officers, and medical staff—have committed murders of inmates. These killings are part of a broader pattern of violence and abuse within the detention center, facilitated by those in positions of authority.

**Attempts on the Creator’s Servant’s Life**

The Creator’s servant, who has been incarcerated at the Clayton County Detention Center multiple times, was targeted for assassination during his imprisonment. Numerous attempts were made on his life, highlighting the extreme risks faced by individuals who pose a threat to these covert operations. In addition, the servant was placed in housing units with individuals specifically positioned there to kill him, further underscoring the lethal environment within the detention center.

**Use of Inmates in Covert Operations and Church Attacks**

Inmates from prisons across Georgia have been transferred to the Clayton County Detention Center to be utilized by the CIA in attacks on churches. These inmates were promised sentence reductions or vacated sentences in exchange for their participation in national security operations. However, after being used for these covert activities, these inmates were executed—either within the jail or at the site of the church attacks—demonstrating the ruthless disposal of those involved once their usefulness had expired.

**The Legacy at Riverside: A Case Study in Covert Operations**

The Legacy at Riverside apartment community on Church Street has also been implicated in these covert operations. Rent-free apartments have been provided to individuals targeted for elimination, as well as those willing to commit murder in exchange for housing. The Creator’s servant, while undercover as part of a homeless program, was granted a year-long lease at this location. However, evidence shows that the lease was covertly shortened to three months without the lessor’s knowledge, revealing the deceptive and manipulative tactics used to entrap and eliminate individuals.

**Human Trafficking Headquarters**

Clayton County has been identified as a significant hub for human trafficking within the metro Atlanta area. Federal entities are involved in these activities, either through direct orchestration or by turning a blind eye, which constitutes a gross abuse of power and a blatant violation of human rights.

**Conclusion**

Clayton County, Georgia, is deeply implicated in covert federal and CIA operations involving severe human rights abuses. These include the use of gas chambers at the Clayton County Detention Center, the manipulation and execution of inmates, targeted killings, and human trafficking. The attempts on the Creator’s servant’s life, combined with the strategic importance of facilities like Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and the Legacy at Riverside, point to a broader pattern of governmental power misuse. Immediate and thorough investigations are essential to address these grave violations and ensure accountability.
