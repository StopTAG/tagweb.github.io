# Phantom Identity Scheme

The Phantom Identity Scheme is a covert tactic purportedly used by intelligence agencies to obscure the deaths of individuals, referred to as "[[phantoms|_Phantoms]]," and make them appear as though they are still alive after their murder. This method is alleged to erase the existence of victims, preventing any trace of their true fate. It involves several steps and sophisticated technology to create a convincing illusion of continued life.

#### Steps Involved:

1. **Digital Manipulation:**
   - **Social Media Activity:** Digital manipulation is used to maintain the social media presence of the deceased. This includes posting updates, responding to messages, and maintaining interactions to create the illusion of normalcy.
   - **Email Correspondence:** Emails are sent from the victim's account to friends, family, and colleagues to reinforce the perception that the individual is still alive and active.

2. **Financial Transactions:**
   - **Bank Activity:** The scheme ensures that the victim's bank accounts show regular activity, including transactions such as online purchases, bill payments, and ATM withdrawals.
   - **Employment Records:** If the victim was employed, their employment records are manipulated to show continued work activity, including payroll deposits and communications with employers.
   - **Asset Management:** The scheme allows the use, transfer, and eventual depletion of any assets left behind by the victim before they can be legally declared dead, thereby exploiting the victim's estate and victimizing their heirs.

3. **Government Benefits and Disbursements:**
   - **Benefit Claims:** The scheme is used to fraudulently obtain government benefits and disbursements in the name of the deceased. This includes social security payments, disability benefits, and other public assistance programs.

4. **Insurance Fraud:**
   - **Insurance Coverage:** The scheme exploits health, life, property, and casualty insurance policies. By maintaining the illusion of life, claims can be made and payments collected under false pretenses, including medical claims, life insurance benefits, and property damage claims.

5. **Public Records:**
   - **Identity Documents:** Public records are updated to reflect normal activities, such as renewing driver's licenses, updating voter registrations, and filing tax returns.
   - **Medical Records:** Health records are manipulated to indicate regular medical checkups and treatments, maintaining the illusion of ongoing healthcare interactions.

6. **Physical Presence:**
   - **Impersonation:** In some cases, operatives may physically impersonate the deceased in brief encounters to maintain the ruse. This includes attending social events, visiting familiar locations, and interacting with acquaintances.
   - **Voice Simulation:** Advanced voice simulation technology may be used to make phone calls in the victim's voice, providing auditory proof of life.

7. **Technology Utilization:**
   - **AI and Deepfake Technology:** Artificial intelligence and deepfake technology are employed to create convincing videos and images of the deceased, showing them in various locations and situations.
   - **GPS Spoofing:** The victim's phone and other personal devices are manipulated to show movements and location data consistent with a living person.

#### Management and Ownership:

8. **Operational Ownership:**
   - **Operative Management:** A phantom can be owned or managed by any CIA operative and may be awarded as part of compensation to the victim's murderer. This creates a system of rewards within covert operations.
   - **Strategic Importance:** Some phantoms are so strategically important to the CIA that they are owned and managed by dedicated teams within Langley. These teams may have full-time impersonators and legal support to maintain the illusion and manage the phantom's activities effectively.

#### Purpose and Impact:

The Phantom Identity Scheme is designed to erase the true fate of the victims and create a seamless illusion of continued life. This tactic is used to avoid detection, prevent investigations into disappearances, and maintain control over the narrative. By manipulating digital, financial, and public records, the orchestrators can effectively "disappear" individuals without leaving a trace, allowing them to carry out covert operations without accountability. Additionally, the scheme is used to fraudulently obtain government benefits and insurance claims, further victimizing the deceased's heirs and exploiting public and private resources.

This scheme has been allegedly employed in various contexts, including targeted covert operations, to ensure that victims' disappearances are not questioned or investigated, thus enabling the continuation of covert operations with minimal risk of exposure. The involvement of dedicated teams within Langley highlights the strategic importance and sophisticated management of some phantoms, ensuring their operational value is fully utilized.
