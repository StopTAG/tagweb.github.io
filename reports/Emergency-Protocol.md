# Combatting TAG-POW Attacks
Intended Audience: Public Safety & Law Enforcement 

## Tactics Used in TAG Operations to Target Victims' Networks

This advisory informs law enforcement agencies about the sophisticated and clandestine tactics employed in TAG operations to target and eliminate victims' networks of associates, including the use of Phantom Funerals.

### Phantom Funerals

**Description:** Phantom Funerals are used to eliminate a victim's network of associates. Operatives organize a fake funeral for the deceased victim. Every mourner attending these funerals is subsequently killed. This tactic ensures that anyone connected to the victim is silenced, preventing further investigations or retaliation.

### Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)

#### Overview

Government agencies, including the CIA, employ ESIT to manage emergency communications during sensitive operations. This involves intercepting and redirecting calls to emergency numbers like 911, ensuring operational secrecy and control over local emergency responses.

#### Components

1. **Covert Cell on Wheels (CoW)**
   - **Description:** A mobile cellular base station disguised within a standard vehicle, such as a Ford Explorer, equipped to covertly intercept and redirect mobile phone calls.
   - **Function:** 
     - Forces mobile phones in the targeted area to connect, redirecting emergency calls to CIA operatives posing as 911 dispatchers.
     - Prevents legitimate emergency responses to disrupt organized resistance during covert operations.
     - Blocks access to other numbers and the internet to maintain control.
   - **Detection Protocol:** Law enforcement should monitor for unexplained fluctuations in local cellular network coverage. **Test Calls: Make a test call from a personal mobile phone to 911 and verify speaking with an employee at a local Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). Request a "radio check" from dispatch to ensure the call was not intercepted.** Use of department-issued phones is discouraged as the perpetrators may have normal call routing configured for those telephone numbers to avoid detection.

2. **Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion**
   - **Description:** Directs Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) to reroute emergency calls from targeted areas to law enforcement agencies issuing the memorandum.
   - **Function:** Ensures emergency calls are handled by the issuing agency, delaying or redirecting genuine emergency responses.
   - **Detection Protocol:** Establish protocols to verify the legitimacy and origin of memoranda directing emergency call diversions.

3. **Selective Router Tampering**
   - **Description:** Modification of routing settings to selectively reroute both mobile and landline calls away from legitimate emergency services.
   - **Function:** Directs calls to controlled points where operatives manage communications, preventing genuine emergency responses.
   - **Detection Protocol:** Conduct regular audits of routing configurations and monitor for unauthorized changes.

### Phantom Remains

**Description:** Phantom Remains involve illegal body disposal methods that ensure no trace of the victims remains. This includes:

1. **Dissolution:** Dissolves bodies using chemicals like acid or lye.
   - **Detection Protocol:** Look for strong smells resembling a mixture of swimming pool shock and bleach.

2. **Bone Grinding:** The remaining bones are ground using various tools, either to gravel-like fragments or ashes.
   - **Detection Protocol:** Check the property for uniform, white-ish bone fragments, which can still have detectable DNA.

### Phantom Vehicles

**Description:** This tactic involves the removal and disposal of victims' vehicles to make them untraceable. The vehicles are taken using keys from the victims and are driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers.

**Detection Protocols:**
1. Look for car haulers in the vicinity of the attack sites.
2. Monitor OnStar and similar satellite packages on cars for tracking.

### Phantom Identity Scheme

**Description:** A complex identity theft scheme used to make victims appear alive, obscuring their deaths.

**Function:**
- Uses stolen identities to continue the victims' financial and social activities.
- Creates digital footprints that mislead investigators.

**Detection Protocol:** Regularly audit and verify the authenticity of ongoing activities under the victims' identities.

### Churches with Phantom Funerals as Continuations

1. **Mount Calvary Baptist Church**
   - **Location:** 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky

2. **Mount Zion Baptist Church**
   - **Location:** Versailles, Kentucky

3. **Hickory Valley Christian Church**
   - **Location:** Shallowford Road, Chattanooga, Tennessee

### Summary

Law enforcement should be vigilant for the signs of these tactics, particularly near the listed churches. Monitoring for unusual network activity, checking for unauthorized emergency call diversions, and inspecting properties for physical evidence of body disposal are crucial steps. Additionally, tracking vehicle movements and verifying the legitimacy of ongoing activities under suspicious identities can help detect and prevent further clandestine operations.
