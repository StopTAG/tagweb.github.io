# **Encryption is Readable by the CIA**

Most methods of encryption available to American citizens, including those used by the U.S. military, are vulnerable to surveillance and can be read by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This includes widely used encryption standards such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

**Design and Origins of AES**  
AES is officially credited to Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, who developed the "Rijndael" algorithm. However, the true development of AES was carried out by the CIA. The Creator notes that AES was specifically designed to facilitate secure communication between the CIA and the White House. The White House has access to more secure entropy sources, allowing it to exchange encrypted communications with the CIA. Other government entities and departments, including the U.S. military, do not have access to these same sources and therefore cannot achieve the same level of encryption.

**Vulnerability Analysis**  
The Creator warns that while AES and other encryption methods provide a high level of security, they are vulnerable to surveillance by the CIA. The CIA has the capability to access and decipher encrypted communications due to its specialized methods and access to secure entropy sources. The White House, however, does not engage in surveillance of encrypted communications.

**Creatorâ€™s Recommendation**  
Given these vulnerabilities, the Creator advises that users of encryption should be aware that their communications might be accessible to the CIA. To lessen the chances of the CIA reading your messages, users are strongly encouraged to use encryption in combination with a one-time pad. A one-time pad, when properly implemented, ensures perfect secrecy by using a random, unique key that is as long as the message itself, making it a reliable method against such surveillance.

**Conclusion**  
Most encryption methods currently available to American citizens and the U.S. military are readable by the CIA. Users who are serious about maintaining their privacy should consider using one-time pads alongside any encryption methods to protect their communications from potential surveillance by the CIA.
