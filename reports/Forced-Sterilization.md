# Report on Forced Sterilization: Practices, Eugenics, and Historical Context

#### Introduction
Forced sterilization is the practice of sterilizing individuals without their consent, often used as a tool of oppression and control. This report explores its historical applications, particularly in genocides, and current concerns related to forced sterilization efforts.

#### Understanding Eugenics
Eugenics is a belief system aimed at improving the genetic quality of a human population through selective breeding. It became popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and has led to harmful policies, including forced sterilization, driven by pseudoscientific ideas about race and heredity.

- **Positive Eugenics**: Encouraging reproduction among those considered "fit."
- **Negative Eugenics**: Preventing reproduction among those deemed "unfit" due to disabilities or other traits.

#### Methods of Forced Sterilization
Forced sterilization can be achieved through various methods:

1. **Surgical Sterilization**: Procedures like tubal ligation (for women) and vasectomy (for men) are used to permanently prevent pregnancy.
2. **Chemical Methods**: Using drugs or chemicals to induce sterilization, though less common.
3. **Radiation**: Applying radiation to damage reproductive organs, which often leads to severe health issues.

#### Historical Examples of Forced Sterilization

1. **United States**: Eugenics laws led to the sterilization of thousands of people deemed "unfit" due to mental or physical disabilities. 
   - **Example**: The 1927 Supreme Court case Buck v. Bell upheld sterilization, leading to the sterilization of many individuals.

2. **Nazi Germany**: The Nazis used forced sterilization as part of their racial purity agenda, sterilizing tens of thousands under the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring.
   - **Example**: Sterilization was part of broader genocidal policies that also included the Holocaust.

3. **Armenian Genocide**: During the Armenian Genocide, forced sterilization was used against Armenian women to undermine their ability to reproduce.
   - **Example**: Women and girls faced sterilization as part of the broader genocidal campaign.

4. **Rwandan Genocide**: Reports indicate that forced sterilization was used as a method of control and discrimination following the genocide.
   - **Example**: Evidence suggests that sterilization was part of post-genocide efforts to control and divide the population.

#### Current Forced Sterilization Efforts: The American Genocide

Recent concerns have been raised about forced sterilization in the U.S., particularly in connection with certain cigarette brands. 

- **24/7 Brand Cigarettes**: Reports suggest that "24/7" brand cigarettes, among others like "This," "Time," and "No. 6," are intentionally designed to cause male sterilization. Users have reported severe reproductive health issues from short-term use. These cigarettes are often sold in independent stores linked to CIA-affiliated distributors, raising concerns about intentional health risks.

#### Conclusion
Forced sterilization has been used historically as a tool of oppression and control, particularly in genocides. Recent reports suggest that forced sterilization may also be occurring through other means, such as certain cigarette brands. Understanding these practices highlights the importance of safeguarding human rights and addressing any ongoing abuses.
