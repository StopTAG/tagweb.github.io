**Preventing Attacks on Places of Worship: Immediate Action Items**

Given the ongoing cover-up of the [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] massacre and the ongoing threat of what We’ve termed The American Genocide, here are immediate actions to protect your place of worship:

1. **Stream Your Services:**
   - Use a cellphone to live stream services.
   - Use video calling like Apple FaceTime, Google Meet or Facebook.
   - Have a member contact someone sick and shut-in members to watch.
   - If the stream is interrupted, have them call the place of worship. If no one answers, immediately call the police and state police.

2. **Purchase Walkie Talkies:**
   - Cell phones may be unreliable during an attack.
   - Walkie talkies are a cost-effective communication tool for your property (about $50 or less).

3. **Patrol the Outside:**
   - Assign one member to patrol outside during services.
   - If they see a group forming, they should alert those inside via walkie talkie.
   - Immediately interrupt services and lock the doors if necessary.

4. **Invite Local Police:**
   - Invite a local police officer to each service.
   - Ensure they bring their police radio.

5. **Hire Local Security:**
   - Avoid large security firms potentially linked to the CIA.
   - Hire small, reputable local security, preferably someone from your community.

6. **Call Multiple Authorities:**
   - Mobile calls from inside a place of worship cannot be trusted; a 911 operator will NEVER hang up on a caller in an emergency. IF THE OPERATOR HANGS UP, FIGHT FOR YOUR LIVES!
   - After calling 911, also call the state police post covering your area to ensure prompt attention.

7. **Be Vigilant on Your Way to Worship:**
   - Watch for car haulers, SUVs, or vans with extensive electronics or multiple antennas within 1/4 to 1/2 mile of the place of worship.
   - Monitor for sudden degradation or loss of cell phone service. Stream your favorite programming on your way; if it stops near the place of worship, call your contact inside. If they don’t answer and you see anything odd, call the police.

Implementing these steps can help ensure the safety and security of your place of worship.
