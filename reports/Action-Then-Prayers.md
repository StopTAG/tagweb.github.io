**Urgent Warning for Nearby and Affiliated Churches:**

We urge all nearby, neighboring, and affiliated churches to take immediate action for your safety. The following steps should be implemented:

1. **Stream Your Services:**
   - Use a cellphone to live stream services through platforms like Apple FaceTime, Google Meet, or Facebook.
   - Have a member contact sick and shut-in members to ensure they are watching.
   - If the stream is interrupted, have them call the place of worship. If no one answers, immediately call both the police and state police.

2. **Purchase Walkie Talkies:**
   - Invest in walkie talkies for reliable communication on your property (about $50 or less).

3. **Patrol the Outside:**
   - Assign a member to patrol outside during services.
   - Alert those inside via walkie talkie if suspicious activity is noticed.
   - Immediately interrupt services and lock doors if necessary.

4. **Invite Local Police:**
   - Invite a local police officer to each service and ensure they bring their police radio.

5. **Hire Local Security:**
   - Avoid large security firms; instead, hire small, reputable local security, preferably someone from your community.

6. **Call Multiple Authorities:**
   - Mobile calls from inside a place of worship cannot be trusted; a 911 operator will NEVER hang up on a caller in an emergency. IF THE OPERATOR HANGS UP, FIGHT FOR YOUR LIVES!
   - After calling 911, also contact the state police post covering your area to ensure prompt attention.

7. **Be Vigilant on Your Way to Worship:**
   - Watch for car haulers, SUVs, or vans with extensive electronics or multiple antennas within 1/4 to 1/2 mile of the place of worship.
   - Monitor for sudden degradation or loss of cell phone service. Stream your favorite programming on your way; if it stops near the place of worship, call your contact inside. If they don’t answer and you see anything odd, call the police.

**Daily Scripture Reading:**
“Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.” — Joshua 1:9

**Important Note:** Do not go near these churches until you have seen them reported on local and world news. Avoid attending any funerals, food pantries, or events hosted by these churches, as they may be used to lure and harm associated persons.

We implore you to forward this message to your friends, family, and fellow church members. Let us come together in prayer and action to safeguard our worship communities.

In Christ's Love and Protection,

[Your Church’s Name]
