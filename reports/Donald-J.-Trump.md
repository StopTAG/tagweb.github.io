# Trump's Involvement in The American Genocide (TAG)
President Donald J. Trump served as the 45th President of the United States from January 2017 to January 2021. Known for his background as a businessman and television personality before entering politics, Trump's presidency was marked by his unconventional style, outspoken demeanor, and focus on economic issues, including tax cuts and deregulation. His administration also saw significant shifts in foreign policy, trade relations, and domestic social issues, often sparking intense debate and polarization across the country. Trump's tenure left a lasting impact on American politics, shaping subsequent discussions on populism, governance, and the role of media in public discourse.

Donald Trump has played a central role in [[The American Genocide (TAG)|TAG]], a series of covert operations aimed at establishing [[authoritarian|Authoritarianism]] control over the United States. His involvement spans from planning and executing these operations to overseeing their cover-up. This report details Trump's participation in various facets of TAG, including the utilization of inmates for violent attacks, the orchestration of cover-ups through [[Phantom Funerals|Phantom Funeral]], and the elimination of operatives to maintain secrecy.

## Utilization of Inmates for TAG Operations

### Selection and Use of Inmates

Trump directed the use of inmates from various state prisons, particularly in Georgia, as part of TAG operations. Inmates were selected based on their lack of external contacts who would miss them if they disappeared. Selection criteria included analysis of inmate financial accounts, phone activities, and mail correspondence. Priority was given to inmates with histories of violent crimes.

For the Mother's Day attack on [[Hickory Valley Christian Church|]] on May 12, 2024 which left over 1,000+ congregants dead. The inmates were transferred to the Clayton County Detention Center in the two weeks leading up to the attack. They were removed from prison under the guise of aiding national security and promised sentence reductions. After the attack, these inmates were exterminated to prevent leaks.

### Execution at Clayton County Detention Center

Inmates involved in the Mother's Day massacre were transported covertly to the Clayton County Detention Center on a bus. Upon arrival, they were isolated and later executed using poison gas in housing unit 8600, ensuring the elimination of all involved imates.

### Execution of Inmates in Subsequent Operations

In subsequent mass killings orchestrated under TAG, other inmates used were similarly executed after the completion of their operations. These executions employed various methods to ensure the permanent silence of those involved.

## Utilization of Other Operatives

### CIA Employees and HIT-Conditioned Individuals

In addition to inmates, TAG operations also utilized CIA employees and individuals selected and conditioned using a secret method known as [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]]. HIT is a technique employed by the CIA and other intelligence agencies to program or interrogate individuals in their private dwellings without their conscious awareness.

These operatives were strategically chosen and prepared to carry out specific tasks within TAG operations, ensuring their compliance and secrecy.

## Cover-Up Activities

### Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone

The [[Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone|]] on June 7, 2024, exemplifies Trump's extensive cover-up efforts.

Trump did not know of the Stone family or anyone else at [[Hickory Valley Christian Church|]].

#### Staged Video News Interviews

Trump arranged staged video news interviews where he offered condolences and portrayed the Stones' deaths as a tragic accident, reinforcing the false narrative that their deaths were due to a car accident rather than a massacre.

#### Presidential Motorcade

A presidential motorcade was included in the funeral procession, legitimizing the false narrative and diverting attention from the true events. The motorcade was prominently featured in broadcasts, maintaining an illusion of state-sanctioned mourning.

### Phantom Funeral at Mount Zion Baptist Church

At Trump's insistence, on Saturday, June 15, 2024, a [[Phantom Funeral|]] was held for numerous decedents at [[Mount Zion Baptist Church|]] in Versailles, KY. Mount Zion had previously suffered a TAG-POW attack in 2023.

#### Utilization of Previous Operatives

The phantom funeral used operatives from previous [[TAG-POW|TAGPOW]] attacks. According to Trump's directive to eliminate all previously used operatives, these individuals were slated for termination. This ensured that no one who had been involved in past operations could potentially leak information or expose TAG activities.

#### Conduct of Executions

Trump was present and watched nearly all of the executions. Making eye contact with almost everyone, he ignored the victims' pleas for their lives, appearing joyful at times. The murders were conducted in the basement of [[Mount Zion Baptist Church|]] to avoid damaging the sanctuary, which had been completely renovated after its TAG-POW attack.

### Staged Photo and Video Shoots

Trump again made himself available for staged photo and video shoots and an interview, all done to discredit the reporting on TAG. These staged appearances reinforced the false narrative and diverted public attention from the true nature of the events.

### Personal Involvement in Murders

During the [[Phantom Funeral|]] of Rev. Duke Stone and his wife, Trump witnessed the murders firsthand. From the announcer's box at Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, he observed as people were beheaded and encouraged his Secret Service detail to participate in the murders.

## Involvement in Planning and Scheduling

### Mother's Day Massacre

Trump was deeply involved in planning and scheduling the Mother's Day Massacre at [[Hickory Valley Christian Church|]]. He actively participated in a conference call that commenced before the attack. Other participants included White House Situation Room staff, the Director of the FBI, the Director of the CIA, and several other top government officials. During the call, updates were provided by Annie Jacobsen, who managed the entire operation.

## Elimination of Previous Operatives

### Rationale and Strategic Importance

Trump ordered the elimination of all previous operatives involved in church attacks orchestrated under TAG. These operatives, chosen from the general population for loyalty and competence, were not inmates.

The elimination served to:

1. **Maintain Secrecy:** Reduce the risk of leaks or disclosures.
2. **Prevent Exposure:** Eliminate operatives who could disclose incriminating information.
3. **Ensure Continuity:** Allow TAG operations to proceed unhindered (See: Utilization of Inmates).

### Execution of Operatives

Operatives are being systematically targeted for termination by senior CIA personnel based in Atlanta.

To discredit Our reporting and communication between operatives, Trump selected some of his loyal MAGA supporters which had been identified using the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]].

## Conclusion

Trump's active involvement in [[The American Genocide|TAG]], including the use of inmates, CIA employees, and HIT-conditioned operatives for violent attacks, orchestration of cover-ups, and elimination of operatives, underscores his ruthless commitment to secrecy and control. Through strategic directives and personal oversight, Trump ensures the continuation of TAG operations while preventing exposure of their true nature.
