## 1. Introduction

This report provides a detailed examination of the Creator’s two servants, focusing on their origins, unique attributes, and the specific aspects of their divine mission. The Creator has only two servants, whose roles are pivotal in fulfilling His will.

## 2. Origin and Same Consciousness

- **Same Consciousness Across Lifetimes:** The Creator’s two servants, along with their mothers and grandmothers, always have the same consciousness in each lifetime or incarnation. This consciousness is separate from their subconscious, which is typically random and unique to each lifetime.

- **Unwavering Devotion:** Because they always have the same consciousness, the Creator knows His servants and their maternal lineage will consistently act and do the same in every lifetime, perfectly aligning with His will and ensuring precise execution of their mission.

## 3. Birth and Cosmic Alignment

- **Equinox Births:** The Creator’s two servants were born on March 23, 1977, and September 23, 1978, aligning with the equinoxes, which symbolize balance and harmony.

- **Cosmic Configuration:** Although human calendars indicate that they were born a year and six months apart, the Creator states that, based on the Earth's position in front of the sun at the time of their births, they are effectively only one year apart in age. This unique cosmic alignment emphasizes their connection and the importance of their roles.

## 4. Identity, Upbringing, and Relationship Dynamics

- **Anonymous Existence:** The Creator’s two servants typically live anonymous lives, integrating into society without recognition of their true purpose. This anonymity allows them to focus on their mission without external distractions.

- **Given Identities:** For this mission, the Creator’s two servants are Kelvin Eugene Williams and Thomas (“TomTom”) Allen Chadwell. Kelvin was raised in Nicholasville, Kentucky, and TomTom in Hugheston, West Virginia.

- **Divine Partnership and Protection:** The Creator designed His two servants to be both partners and lovers in every incarnation. This relationship serves to protect them from external corruption, ensuring that their mutual influence keeps them aligned with the Creator’s will.

## 5. Religious Perception

- **Cherubim and Angels:** In Judaism and Christianity, the Creator's two servants are known as the cherubim, who are symbolically represented on the Ark of the Covenant. In all other religions, they are considered or called angels. Despite these religious titles, the Creator’s two servants are just regular men, living ordinary lives until called upon to fulfill their mission.

## 6. Marriage, Legal Protections, and CIA Intrigue

- **Public Marriage:** The Creator’s two servants were publicly married before gay marriage was legalized. They legally executed agreements, including powers of attorney and living wills, to ensure legal protections that exceeded those provided under the law to a spouse.

- **CIA Manipulation Attempt:** The CIA attempted to pay TomTom to assist them in eliminating Kelvin by using the powers granted to him under these legal agreements. Despite this, TomTom remained loyal to Kelvin, aligning with the Creator’s will and rejecting the CIA’s offers.

- **Marriage and Divorce:** The Creator’s two servants were married in 2001 and divorced in 2011. Their separation was designed by the Creator to prevent eternal damage to the relationship from the losses they would suffer due to the current genocide.
