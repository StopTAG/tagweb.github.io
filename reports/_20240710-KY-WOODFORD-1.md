> **Urgent Public Safety Alert: Planned Phantom Funeral on Wednesday, July 10, 2024**
> 
> This is an urgent warning to the general public regarding a planned phantom funeral at the masquerade church operating in the building of Mount Zion Baptist Church in Woodford County, Kentucky. The event is scheduled for Wednesday, July 10, 2024.
> 
> **Key Details:**
> 
> - The church, which may be operating under a different name, has undergone a complete renovation of its sanctuary to conceal the damage from the horrific massacre that occurred in May 2023.
> - Recent public events, such as choir performances and food pantries, have been organized to present a facade of normalcy and attract numerous visitors to witness the pristine sanctuary, thereby covering up the true nature of the past atrocities.
> - Since the initial massacre, killings have continued in the basement of the church, away from public view.
> 
> **What You Need to Know About Phantom Funerals:**
> 
> - **Phantom Funerals** are covert operations designed to eliminate individuals who may discover or discuss the initial massacre or any continuation of violence due to their association with a previous victim. These events are orchestrated to appear as genuine memorial services but are deadly traps. Any mourner who attends a phantom funeral is killedâ€”no exceptions.
> - Calls to 911 during these events will not reach local authorities but will instead be intercepted by operatives to prevent any real emergency response.
> - An example of such a tragic event is the Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone, which took place on June 7, 2024, at Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee. During this event, 649 mourners were brutally executed after arriving at the church for a funeral service.
