### The Speed-Induced Paranoia Propelling TAG



#### Introduction



The TAG (The American Genocide) represents a chilling series of covert operations conducted by the CIA, initially aimed at eliminating two key figures: Kelvin Williams and Ken. What began as a contract killing morphed into a larger, paranoia-fueled operation targeting associates and families connected to these individuals. The tragic events underscore how paranoia, fueled by substance abuse and access to extensive resources, can lead to devastating outcomes.



#### The Catalyst: Ken's Death and Spark



Ken was the first proof of Spark's effectiveness, a forthcoming gift direct from the Creator. Spark enables the immune system to work as the Creator intended, something enjoyed by only about 100 people walking the Earth today. Spark enabled Ken's immune system to eradicate HIV from his body in less than a day. Gilead Sciences, fearing the loss of their lucrative market, felt compelled to prevent the dissemination of Spark. Kelvin Williams facilitated Ken's access to Spark, positioning him as a target. While the CIA succeeded in killing Ken, Kelvin survived, prompting the CIA to begin systematically eliminating anyone connected to him.



#### The Expanded Target Network



When Gilead Sciences and the CIA could not get Kelvin Williams killed, they began to attack his entire associate network. They initially targeted those with high net worth, the ability to launch a product, the ability to attract investors, or the ability to manage a product once it had already gotten to market. Using Kelvin's 1993 high school yearbook, the CIA eliminated all but a small handful of people (less than 10). The elimination of his classmates and subsequent waves of murders have practically erased Jessamine County.

#### The Orr Chapel Tragedy



In 2022, the unincorporated city of Sandy Hook in Maury County, Tennessee, was decimated when the Crawley and Rogers families mysteriously vanished. This marked the beginning of the CIA’s mass killings under TAG. Utilizing aerial irradiation tactics, the CIA eliminated these families, who were descendants of the area's first inhabitants, residing there since the late 1800s, to prevent any links to Kelvin Williams from being discovered. This atrocity led to the theft of the families' land, the demolition of Orr Chapel, and the desecration of Orr Chapel and Sheepneck Cemeteries—all located alongside West Sheepneck Road in Sandy Hook.



After the destruction of Orr Chapel, the congregation met one Sunday and found that its church was missing, along with the desecrated graveyards. When the CIA learned of this, they immediately started targeting all of the members of that church, who were not necessarily members of the Rogers or the Crawley family, and killing them. Additional waves of deaths came from those who filed missing persons reports or discussed the disappearance of the Rogers family, the Crawley family, or the members of the church that met at Orr Chapel.



#### Mount Calvary Baptist Church Massacre

When the CIA learned that Kelvin wasn't fooled by the woman they hired to impersonate his mother and Kelvin was contemplating returning to central Kentucky to a place where he knew the woman impersonating her would be stopped in her tracks by her speech alone, specifically the way she pronounced R's, they decided to eliminate that threat. On April 2, 2023, Jacobsen led a team of more than 50 men to massacre Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky. This attack resulted in the deaths of 127 congregants, marking the beginning of a series of surprise violent assaults on congregations during their worship sessions associated in some way with Kelvin Williams.

After the massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, the CIA illegally occupied the property to kill anyone who came to the church. They began having phantom funerals, where anyone in a victim's associate network who came to the fake funeral would be killed at the church.



#### Attack on Lexington Bethel Baptist Church



Noticing odd behaviors from their longtime neighbor, Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, which is a stone's throw from Mount Calvary Baptist Church, sent a delegation over to Mount Calvary to check on their well-being. Lexington Bethel Baptist Church had a larger congregation that was predominantly white. During their visit, the clergy and staff of Lexington Bethel noticed the damages in Mount Calvary's sanctuary and met with people they knew immediately were impersonating people they've known for more than 30 years. Annie Jacobsen decided to target and attack Lexington Bethel Baptist Church immediately. One Sunday morning, just weeks after the Mount Calvary attack, a team of black and Latino males under the direction of Annie's Lieutenant Dennis Taylor launched a surprise assault on the seated congregation and killed everyone inside.

#### Subsequent Church Attacks

The CIA under the direction of  Annie Jacobsen or “Hurricane Annie” conducted another four more surprise assaults on seated congregations before the moving on another church that Kelvin Williams was loosely affiliated with, Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, TN in a Mother’s Day attack that left more than 1,000 people dead. The targeting of the church was done based solely on the fact that the clergy there had believed Kelvin when he warned them of the attack on his lifelong church, Mount Calvary Baptist Church, and the fact that in a call by one of their pastors to the masquerade church left behind by the CIA Pastor Dyer spoke with Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams’ impersonator and Rev. Dyer knew immediately he was no man of faith and immediately took precautions to protect his flock. Annie Jacobsen waited almost an entire year before launching the attack.

#### The Role of Speed-Induced Paranoia

Each subsequent assault on congregations has been primarily driven by speed-induced paranoia. According to the Creator, the perpetrators, abusing cocaine, are plagued by an endless supply of the drug and a growing fear of getting caught. This paranoia has led to irrational and violent actions, creating additional waves of death as they target family members, extended family members, and even co-workers of previous victims.

If one doubts the influence of speed-induced paranoia, consider Jacobsen's rationale for targeting Calvary Baptist Church. For decades, the church has operated a preschool and daycare program. In the early 1980s, Kelvin's mother, Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, worked at Kentucky Central, just a few blocks away from Calvary Baptist Church. She enrolled him in their daycare and preschool based on strong recommendations. However, after he started kindergarten, neither his mother nor he maintained any contact with the church, school, or anyone associated with these programs. Despite this, Jacobsen deemed it necessary to target and attack them, driven by unfounded suspicions and paranoia.

The common thread linking these horrific events is the CIA's paranoia. Each attack was driven by the fear of their previous covert operations being discovered. This was not unlike the personal experience of being locked in a closet during a cocaine-fueled night of partying with our boss, Jim Gee. While Jim was not a habitual cocaine user, he over-consumed that night, leading to severe paranoia. Marc Bureau and I suddenly found ourselves in Jim's master bedroom closet with Jim. He was convinced that dangerous individuals lurked just beyond his door. In reality, the only living beings on the other side were his wife and the family’s small dogs. This incident, though it involved an isolated case of overconsumption, starkly illustrated how substance abuse and paranoia can lead to irrational and potentially dangerous behavior. Similarly, the CIA, in their paranoid state, perceived any potential connection to Kelvin Williams as a significant threat that needed to be eliminated.
