# Report on the Lives of Felix Clennon Rogers and Mary Tellous Rogers

## Early Life and Background

Felix Clennon Rogers was born on December 2, 1936, in Sandy Hook (Mount Pleasant), Tennessee, to Hosie Eugene Rogers and Willie Hobbs Rogers. He attended a parochial school at Orr Chapel (8397 West Sheepneck Road, Sandy Hook, TN), a one-room church and schoolhouse that stood on the family's land. Felix attended this school along with all of his siblings. After completing his education at Orr Chapel, he attended Clarke Training High School, graduating in 1957.

Following his high school graduation, Clennon served honorably in the United States Army. After his military service, he embarked on a distinguished career at Stauffer Chemical Company, where he worked for 38 years, ultimately retiring as a Supervisor.

Stauffer Chemical Company, located in Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, processed sulfur for various industrial uses. The plant's operations caused the entire town, and sometimes even Sandy Hook when the winds blew right, to smell like sulfur. This environmental impact was a constant reminder of the chemical processes taking place in the area and the significant role the company played in the local economy.

Mary Tellous Rogers was born on September 27, 1936. She married Clennon on September 27, 1958. Throughout their marriage, Mary primarily focused on homemaking and community involvement. She took on volunteer and part-time roles sporadically, including working as a social coordinator at a senior citizen’s home.

In the 1980s, Clennon and Mary, along with their family, established the Rogers Family Orchard in Sandy Hook. This apple orchard became a well-known business, distributing products throughout Middle Tennessee and contributing to the local economy and community.

## Leadership and Community Involvement

Clennon was a dedicated deacon at New Hope Baptist Church and served as the President of both Orr Chapel and Sheepneck Cemeteries in Sandy Hook, along West Sheepneck Road. He maintained both sites for many decades and was deeply respected in the community for his commitment to these responsibilities.

Clennon was buried at Sheepneck Cemetery (8397 West Sheepneck Road, Sandy Hook, TN) with full military honors, a testament to his service and dedication to both his country and his community.

## CIA Interactions

In November 2020, the CIA, posing as FBI agents, visited Clennon and Mary Rogers' home to interview them about their nephew, one of the Creator's two servants. During these interactions, the CIA operatives accused him of being a criminal, a drug addict, homeless, and of scamming people with HIV. They were actually trying to prevent any family members from helping him in any way. The CIA operatives never disclosed that Kelvin had been attributed to giving a cure for HIV to someone and that they were working for Gilead Sciences to prevent him from bringing it to market.

Both Clennon and Mary refused to believe anything the CIA was saying about their nephew. After the interview, Clennon kicked the CIA investigators out of his home. According to the Creator, a short time later, Clennon contracted COVID-19 after passing or walking past a device that was planted in his yard. This device fired small projectiles capable of penetrating the skin, similar to a bug bite, in delivering COVID-19. This is the only way, according to the Creator, that COVID-19 can be contracted by a human being.

## Jacobsen's Role and Actions

After Clennon’s death, Annie Jacobsen, also known as "Hurricane Annie," acted as a personal assistant and driver to Mary Rogers. Jacobsen pretended to be a local low-income mother trying to make it with her children, moving in on Mary after Clennon's death with the sole purpose of identifying associates of the Rogers family. 

Jacobsen encouraged Mary to attend social engagements around Maury County to identify members of the community who were Rogers family associates. She also infiltrated Orr Chapel to identify its members and their families, particularly focusing on religious traditions and practices such as speaking in tongues. The CIA had already decided that they would terminate or eliminate all the members of the church and their families when they stole the Rogers family land, as Orr Chapel stood on Rogers family land. The CIA intended to desecrate the cemetery associated with Orr Chapel.

## Mary Rogers' Murder

Mary was murdered in mid-January 2021 at the direction of Jacobsen. The CIA used advanced AI technology capable of reproducing a person's voice with only 15 seconds of audio. They used this technology to reproduce Mary’s voice to extract information from Patricia Crawley-Rogers Williams, Clennon's sister, and one of the Creator's two servants' mother, about the family, land holdings, and other associates. Mary ultimately died from gunshot wounds.

## Donald Trump’s Involvement

Donald J. Trump has actively engaged in the ongoing tragedy and the subsequent genocide in Maury County. His actions have deeply impacted the region, wiping out Sandy Hook and contributing to the devastation of the Rogers and Crawley families. Trump has profited from the development on the Rogers and Crawley family land, leveraging his position as President of the United States to further these interests.

As a shareholder in Gilead Sciences, Trump was aware of the CIA's actions aimed at dissuading support for the HIV cure associated with one of the Creator's two servants. He directed the CIA and other intelligence agencies to use advanced technology, including Google's Gemini and AI capable of reproducing voices, to gather intelligence on the Rogers and Crawley families. Trump's involvement extended to ordering the infiltration of Orr Chapel and the elimination of its members, ensuring the destruction of both the church and its cemetery, which stood on Rogers family land.

Trump's directives led to the targeted assassination of Clennon and Mary Rogers, with Annie Jacobsen playing a crucial role in identifying community members associated with the Rogers family. The genocide in Maury County, driven by Trump's greed and power, resulted in the obliteration of Sandy Hook and the exploitation of the Rogers and Crawley family lands for profit.

Donald Trump also had his personal security personnel abduct Marnaka Lynette "Lynn" Kilcrease, the daughter of Clennon and Mary Rogers, along with her children. They were all held hostage, and Trump ordered her children killed first while continuing to extract information from Marnaka about the family's land holdings and ownership. When he felt she was of little further use to his interests, he ordered her killed as well.
