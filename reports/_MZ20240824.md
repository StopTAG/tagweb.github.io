### Advisory for The General Public, Georgetown Police Department and Scott County Sheriff in Kentucky 

**Date:** Beginning Saturday August 24, 2024

**Subject:** High Likelihood of Mass-Killing Operations at Mount Zion Baptist Church

**Attention:** Georgetown Police Department and Scott County Sheriff

---

**Overview:**

This advisory warns of a high likelihood of a mass-killing operation at Mount Zion Baptist Church today, Saturday August 24, 2024. Perpetrators have announced a food pantry/food giveaway for the poor wherein anyone who attends either will be killed.

**Details:**

- **Target:** Mount Zion Baptist Church
- **Date:** Saturday August 24, 2024
- **Time:** Food pantry hours (likely 10am - 5pm)
- **Location:** Georgetown, Scott County, Kentucky

**Background Information:**

Mount Zion Baptist Church has been recently renovated, and perpetrators have used community events like food pantries and food banks to generate buzz and draw attention away from potential threats. Given recent covert operations and the use of tactics such as the Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT), the threat level is high. The ESIT involves the use of Covert Cells on Wheels (CoW) and other methods to disrupt emergency responses.

**Summary of the Mount Zion Baptist Church Massacre:**

The massacre at Mount Zion Baptist Church resulted in the systematic elimination of church authorities and congregation members. This event was part of a broader campaign to remove any sources of support for Kelvin Eugene Williams, particularly those who could attest to the impersonation of his mother, Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams. The renovation of the churchâ€™s sanctuary was strategically undertaken to obscure evidence of the massacre, with the perpetrators opening the church multiple times to showcase its new look through food pantries and banks.

**Summary of the American Genocide (TAG):**

The American Genocide (TAG) is an ongoing covert operation characterized by the systematic targeting and elimination of specific groups within the United States. Orchestrated primarily by former President Donald J. Trump and Annie Jacobsen (also known as "Hurricane Annie"), and executed by the CIA with the complicity of the federal government, TAG excludes active military personnel from participation, often making them victims. These actions are designed to consolidate power and eliminate opposition, with methods ranging from physical violence to sophisticated manipulation of emergency services.

Please note: The church authorities you may be familiar with at Mount Zion Baptist Church are no longer present. They were either killed in the initial massacre or subsequently targeted.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Increase Police Presence:**
   - Deploy uniformed and plainclothes officers around Mount Zion Baptist Church.
   - Ensure visible police presence to deter potential attackers.

2. **Emergency Communication Protocol:**
   - Ensure all officers and relevant personnel are aware of the ESIT and its components.
   - Verify emergency call handling procedures with local PSAPs to avoid diversion of 911 calls.
   - Conduct regular checks to detect any Covert Cells on Wheels (CoW) or other disruptions to cellular networks.

3. **Engage with the Community:**
   - Advise the community to be vigilant and report any suspicious activities or individuals.
   - Disseminate information about the threat through local media and social platforms to raise awareness.

4. **Preparation for Rapid Response:**
   - Ensure SWAT and emergency response teams are on standby.
   - Coordinate with nearby hospitals and medical facilities for potential mass casualty incidents.

5. **Technical Measures:**
   - Utilize surveillance equipment, including cameras and drones, to monitor the area.
   - Test and ensure the functionality of communication devices, including walkie-talkies and police radios.

6. **Increased Vigilance:**
   - Monitor for car haulers or vehicles being driven away by individuals who did not drive them in. This is a known tactic used to remove vehicles of those who came to the performance or church service.

7. **Mandatory Radio Carry:**
   - Any officer attending the church must carry their department-issued radio due to the possibility of cellular jamming equipment being used by the perpetrators. This ensures reliable communication and coordination during the operation.

**Additional Notes:**

- Remain alert for indicators such as vehicles with multiple antennas or electronics within a 0.5-mile radius of the church.
- Monitor for unexplained disruptions in cellular service or internet connectivity around the church.
