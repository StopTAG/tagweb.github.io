According to [[the Creator|]], [[TAG|]] is unequivocally a genocide. The desires of the political elite to establish an authoritarian regime in the US are advancing this genocide, which they deem necessary to eliminate opposition to authoritarianism. This hidden genocide is fueled by an undercurrent of authoritarianism, political agendas, and narrow viewpoints. Ending it requires direct intervention from Him. The Creator has entrusted His servants with information about these atrocities—some of which is closely guarded or classified—to be shared with the broader public.
