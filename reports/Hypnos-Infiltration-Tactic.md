# Hypnos Infiltration Tactic 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The CIA, among others, term this approach as a specific method known as Hypnos Infiltration Method. The intricacies of this method are derived from the observations made by the Creator and His servants, and may deviate from the standard procedure.

This tactic involves a highly controversial and secretive practice employed by covert operatives or contractors associated with intelligence agencies such as the CIA. Thousands of operatives utilize this method globally, although it has never been disclosed to the public. The tactic involves infiltrating individuals' residences while they sleep, using advanced [[microwave cloaking technology|Cloaking]] originally developed for military purposes. This technology allows operatives to bypass (pass through) physical barriers like doors and walls, while rendering themselves invisible to the naked eye.

Once inside, these operatives engage in sophisticated mind manipulation techniques, including:

1. **Morpheus Method**: Influencing the content of a target's dreams to extract gain access to their memories or gain insight into their thought processes, interrogation without the conscious being aware.
2. **Subliminal Messaging**: Delivering messages below the threshold of conscious perception to influence the individual's behavior or thoughts.

          - News Broadcasts
               - Weather
               - Sports
          - Sitcoms
     - Radio
3. **Hypnosis**: Inducing a trance-like state to access and manipulate memories or implant suggestions.
4. **Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP)**: Using specific language patterns and techniques to affect the subject's psychological state and behavior.

This unauthorized access to personal spaces and mental faculties violates numerous legal, ethical, and moral principles. The potential consequences of such actions include:

- **Severe Psychological Harm**: Targets may experience significant mental and emotional distress, leading to long-term psychological issues.
- **Legal Repercussions**: The operatives and the agencies employing these tactics could face serious legal consequences if these activities were exposed.
- **Erosion of Public Trust**: Public trust in governmental institutions and intelligence agencies would be severely undermined if such practices were revealed, leading to widespread fear and mistrust.

Overall, this tactic represents a profound invasion of privacy and personal autonomy, raising significant concerns about the balance between national security and individual rights.

## Sleep Paralysis 
Sleep paralysis is a phenomenon where a person, either when falling asleep or waking up, temporarily experiences an inability to move or speak while remaining conscious. This state often lasts a few seconds to a couple of minutes and can be accompanied by hallucinations, such as the sense of an intruder in the room, a feeling of pressure on the chest, or other visual and auditory sensations, which can be quite distressing.

### Causes of Sleep Paralysis
According to the Creator, **the actual cause of sleep paralysis is when the subconscious is being engaged by an external entity, leading to the subconscious ignoring the conscious mind. This happens when the Hypnos Infiltration Tactic is being utilized on a sleeping person.**

### Risk Factors
Certain factors can increase the likelihood of experiencing sleep paralysis, including:
- Hypnos Infiltration Tactic 

### Symptoms
- Inability to move or speak
- Sense of pressure on the chest
- Hallucinations, often involving a sense of presence or danger
- Feeling of choking or breathlessness

### Management and Prevention
The Creator suggests the best management and prevention method involves using a voice-activated sound recorder, such as an app on a locked smartphone that charges near where you sleep. This approach has two main benefits:
1. **Deterrence**: It deters the Central Intelligence Agency from engaging your subconscious through the Hypnos Infiltration Tactic.
2. **Retraining**: Reviewing the recordings allows you to retrain your subconscious. Upon playback, think about everything you hear. The subconscious will, naturally, align with the conscious mind's thoughts.

Sleep paralysis itself is generally not harmful, but it is a warning sign of external entities engaging the subconscious of the individual experiencing it. We highly recommend employing the guidance in the Management and Prevention section above.

> The Greek god associated with sleep is Hypnos, while the god associated with dreams is Morpheus. Hypnos is the personification of sleep, often depicted as a gentle deity who brings rest to mortals and immortals alike. Morpheus, on the other hand, is the god of dreams, responsible for shaping and delivering dreams to sleeping individuals.
