# The Massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky

_“A massacre is the killing of a large number of people, especially those who are not involved in any fighting or have no way of defending themselves. A massacre is generally considered to be morally unacceptable, especially when perpetrated by a group of political actors against defenseless victims.”_ - Wikipedia

The massacre was the first massacre of a church's congregation in [TAG (The American Genocide)](https://github.com/TAGIsNoGame/TAG)

## Location 

Mount Calvary Baptist Church is located at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington, KY. The church is in a remote area of Lexington with very low traffic and very few, if any, routine police patrols. The location of Mount Calvary Baptist Church almost makes it ideal for such a massacre. The church’s address conveys urban area, however, if Fayette county were any other county, the church would be in a rural suburb called Pricetown (see [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nZgjiHDMm8bGsM2e7?g_st=ic)).  Lexington is unique in that the city of Lexington spans every square inch of Fayette county.

## Anatomy of Attack

Around 1:30am on the morning of the attack, Kelvin was arrested in Riverdale, Georgia for shoplifting. 



The alleged incident occurred at the Texaco, and while walking back to his apartment, Kelvin walked past a police officer driving slowly on GA-85. As Kelvin turned onto Howard St, the officer pulled up behind him and turned on the lights. Kelvin was questioned, arrested and taken to Clayton County Jail.  Kelvin had multiple attempts made on his life inside the jail. 



The next morning Kelvin was awaken and told he was being transported to DeKalb county. A few minutes later he was escorted out of the housing unit. Kelvin never encountered a single inmate from the jail's general population at anytime during the release process, only CIA personnel posing as inmates and jail employees.  Upon release, Kelvin was placed in the back of a DeKalb County Sheriff's SUV. 



According to the Creator, Annie Jacobsen arrived at Mount Calvary Baptist Church around 11:45 am. Jacobsen was welcomed in by the ushers and found a seat in the rear of the church. Jacobsen focused mainly on her mobile phone. 



Upon arrival at the DeKalb County Detention Center, Kelvin asked the transporting deputy if he could use his mobile phone. Kelvin was concerned about a dog he had, that was locked in a pet carrier in his apartment. 



Kelvin contacted Tracy Thompson of Elizabeth Foundation and asked her if she could help him by caring for the dog while he was incarcerated. Tracy urged him to re-home the dog instead of a temporary shelter, Kelvin agreed. 



After Thompson received the call from Kelvin, she sent a message to Jacobsen advising that Kelvin was now secured at DeKalb County Detention Center. Jacobsen then sent a message to the supervisor of the group outside. The group made up of approximately fifty men and one woman were dressed in all black, few were actual CIA employees, and almost none knew they would be attacking a church. 



Four men armed with shotguns quietly entered the church through the exterior door of the anteroom outside of the women’s restroom on the northwest corner of the church, two of the men went into the adjoining men’s anteroom. The rear entrances are the lesser used entrances with the women’s anteroom being the one generally used due to the relative  location of the access street and parking lot. 



During services, the doors between the anterooms and the  sanctuary are closed to prevent interruptions from other activities that may be occurring in the rear of the church. 



The group that was waiting outside came from the rear parking lot and gathered outside on the front steps of the church, largely undetected by the congregation.

Jacobsen got up from her seat in the sanctuary and went outside and met up with the team gathering in front of the church. Within the sanctuary, congregants noticed men amassing outside the windows on the western side of the church that runs along Pricetown Lane and in front of the church through opened windows. It gave the congregants that seen it the sense that the church was being surrounded, unnerving some. 



Most of the congregation jumped to its feet when they heard the noise from the group gathering in the vestibule. They were alarmed by the number of people in the small room that normally has no more than five or so waiting at any given time, also by the fact that by that point, late in the service, usually no one is trying to enter the sanctuary. 



Jacobsen had obtained a bullhorn outside and announced that she absolutely hated the sermon and that everyone in the church needed to die. 



The individuals who were in the anterooms in the back of the church, opened the doors to the sanctuary with their shotguns at the ready, and the group that had amassed in the vestibule loudly entered the sanctuary. They hurled racial slurs that made the congregation realize that their entrance was not any law enforcement action. After the group's entrance, Jacobsen left the church and went to an area hotel.



Although not a law enforcement action, Kelvin has learned that some in the group were law enforcement, a few of them were at the scene when Kelvin was arrested earlier that morning.



Many in the congregation attempted to call 911 from their mobile phones and their calls were answered on mobile phones  by CIA personnel in another location on mobile phones, not by Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government or any other public safety answering point (PSAP).



Several of the CIA's personnel also attempted to call 911 when they realized they were launching an attack on a congregation during their worship services. 

Jacobsen had directed that the utilization of the [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] begin about ten minutes prior to the bus carrying the operatives arrived at the church.

Inside, the normally peaceful sanctuary became chaotic and terrifying for the congregation almost immediately as the CIA’s personnel acted as instructed.  They raped, pillaged and otherwise terrorized the congregation. Parents did everything to shield their children from the things going on around them. 



In the remote church, far from routine police patrols and while following the orders of Annie Jacobsen the CIA’s personnel began killing. Members of the congregation were taken to the front of the church and beheaded using chainsaws at the piano and organ’s benches. 



The bodies of those slain were placed in the baptismal which is at the front of the church. The baptismal’s water had a formulation added to it which made it chemically cremate the bodies. 



### “Frying Chicken”

The initial operation is referred to by the CIA and others as “Frying Chicken.” The moniker was applied to the operation after the fact because the congregants did fight for their lives. 



## Aftermath 

### Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.

In May 2024 the CIA formed Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. a charade church with a reported address of of 4743 Todds Road in Lexington. Videos produced by the charade and posted on its Facebook page (see warnings) clearly show the interior of Mount Calvary Baptist Church at 4742 Todds Road.



The sanctuary shows evidence of damages from the massacre and a shoddy restoration.
