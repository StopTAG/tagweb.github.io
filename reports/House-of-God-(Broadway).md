# The Massacre of House of God (Broadway)
House of God (Broadway), located in Lexington, Kentucky, a predominantly African-American congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre in May 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance, with the perpetrators disappearing without a trace. Over 300 people were killed.

## Background
House of God on Broadway in Lexington, Kentucky is a Hebrew Pentecostal church that has its weekly worship session on Saturday. 

The church is affiliated with House of God on Georgetown Street which had been massacred previously. 

### Targeting
Annie Jacobsen identified this House of God as a potential threat after the massacre of [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church]] in April of 2023.  While utilizing the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] on the family members of Mount Calvary's Minister of Music, Peter, prior to the attack on the House of God on Georgetown Street. 

Jacobsen decided to target the church immediately after the attack on the  House of God on Georgetown Street. 

## Planning
### Operatives
Annie Jacobsen assembled used team of approximately 75 white males from around the southeast United States, the team was comprised of individuals whom had previously attacked a place of worship with Jacobsen. 

## Execution 
The operatives arranged their own transportation, many carpooling as instructed, and arrived in Lexington on Friday night. On Saturday, beginning around 11 a.m., the operatives met outside the church. Firearms and ammunition were distributed to some of the operatives while gathered outside, along with chainsaws to two of the men. 

Jacobsen had directed that the utilization of the [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] begin about ten minutes prior to storming the church. 

### Surprise 
Jacobsen and the operatives burst into the sanctuary. Jacobsen using a bullhorn made several racially derogatory statements and told the congregation that everyone had to die that day. 

The sanctuary became very chaotic as people tried to escape, many from the congregation were shot and fell to the floor dying a while later. Many fights broke out as churchgoers fought operatives in an attempt to flee or get them out of the sanctuary.  

The operatives had the congregation subdued within about ten minutes. 

Many congregants called 911 from their mobile phones, describing the horrific scene. They were told help was on the way, but none realized they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Lexington-Fayette County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)—a centralized facility responsible for answering and routing emergency calls--due to the FBI & CIA's [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]]. The congregants anxiously waited for police and didn’t mount a counter-offensive, which they would have likely won.

### Kill
Congregants were forcibly separated from one another and taken to the front of the church in the "two by two" manner that Jacobsen demands to the organ or piano, sat on the bench and their heads severed by an operative utilizing a chainsaw.  Some operatives kicked the heads around as if playing soccer.  

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
Operatives tasked with body disposal picked up the body parts and loaded them onto a trailer that had been parked in the rear of the church after the assault began. The body parts were transported to and dissolved in Mount Calvary Baptist Church's baptismal.

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims.

#### Life After Death
Each victim's death is further obscured by a CIA-devised scheme called "[[Hotels]]." The scheme effectively makes  victims appear "alive" after their murder. 

## Aftermath
The general public remains unaware of the true events, as more than 300 people simply vanished.
