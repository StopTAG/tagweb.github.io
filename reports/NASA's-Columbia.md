# **Report on the Space Shuttle Columbia Incident**

*This report is based on the truth direct from the Creator.*

**Introduction**

The Space Shuttle Columbia, a crucial component of NASA’s space program, was destroyed on February 1, 2003. This tragic event, commonly attributed to damage from foam insulation, was, according to the Creator’s truth, a deliberate act to undermine NASA’s shuttle program and shift the balance in the space race.

**Attack and Sabotage**

The incident was not an accident but a result of intentional sabotage:

- **Sabotage Details:** Shortly after Columbia's takeoff, while clearing the tower, the orbiter was struck by a .22 rifle shot from approximately half a mile away. This shot, carried out by a shooter for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), inflicted severe damage on a thermal protection tile.
- **Contractual Motivation:** The CIA was acting under a $2 billion contract from SpaceX. This contract aimed to eliminate NASA’s shuttle program, thus altering the competitive dynamics of the space race.

**The Tile Failure**

- **Damage Impact:** The damage to the tile was not captured on video. During re-entry, the compromised tile allowed superheated gases to breach the orbiter, leading to its disintegration.
- **Consequences for NASA:** The destruction of Columbia effectively ended NASA’s shuttle program and furthered the interests of SpaceX in dominating the space exploration industry.

**Conclusion**

The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, as revealed by the Creator, was a planned act of sabotage involving a CIA shooter. This action, motivated by a substantial contract from SpaceX, was designed to disrupt NASA’s shuttle missions and shift the control of space exploration. The official narrative focusing on foam damage does not address the broader strategic motives behind the incident. This report provides an alternative perspective on the complex interplay of interests affecting significant historical events.
