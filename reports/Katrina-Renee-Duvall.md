### Early Life and Background

Katrina Duvall-Torain was born on January 6, 1983, in Lexington, Kentucky, as it had the closest hospital to her family's home in Nicholasville, located in Jessamine County. She was raised by her mother, [[Patricia Ann Williams|]], along with her half-brother, Kelvin Eugene Williams. The two siblings never viewed each other as half-siblings, as it was always just the three of them. When Kenneth Duvall, Katrina's father, was active in her life, he never stayed longer than a few days at a time at the house. After Patricia ended the relationship with Kenneth, he reduced his involvement in Katrina's life even more.

Katrina also has two other half-siblings, a pair of twins named Nicholas and Nicole.

Katrina attended Brookside Elementary School and East Jessamine Middle School. This was a departure from her brother, Kelvin, who attended Jessamine County Middle and High Schools. Kelvin was six years older, and as the school system grew, newer schools were added. Subsequent districting placed the family's home in the East Jessamine school district. During her middle school years, Katrina was a varsity cheerleader, showcasing her school spirit and leadership qualities.

In 1996, Patricia got married, and she and Katrina moved to Clarksville, Tennessee. Katrina graduated from high school in the Clarksville-Montgomery County school system. During this time, she maintained her faith and was an active member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church until the move.[^3]

### Education

Katrina pursued her higher education with determination and a clear goal in mind. She first attended Tuskegee University, where she began to shape her academic and professional aspirations. Following her time at Tuskegee, she transferred to Auburn University, where she graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice. Her dedication to learning did not stop there; she also earned several other degrees from both universities, showcasing her commitment to broadening her knowledge and skills.

### Career

Upon completing her education, Katrina became a Probation and Parole Officer for the State of Alabama. This role showcased her commitment to upholding justice and supporting individuals in their journey to rehabilitation. Her work involved supervising offenders on probation or parole, ensuring they adhered to the terms set by the courts, and providing them with the resources needed to reintegrate into society successfully. Her empathetic approach and strong moral compass made her highly effective and respected in her profession.

### Personal Life

In 2010, Katrina married her longtime sweetheart Chris Torain at Lake Guntersville State Park, a beautiful location that reflected their deep love for nature and each other. After marrying and settling in Decatur, Alabama, Katrina began attending and joined Daystar Church. Despite this, she remained a member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church.

Katrina and Chris had two children, Kennedy and Karrington. Katrina balanced her demanding career with a vibrant personal life. She was a devoted mother, and her family was the center of her world. Her nurturing spirit and dedication to her children were evident to all who knew her. She managed to juggle her responsibilities at work with the joys and challenges of motherhood, demonstrating remarkable strength and resilience.

In the background are three known CIA operatives: Brian (last name unknown), Annie Jacobsen, and Michael Blackmon.

[^2]: Upon closer inspection of Katrina's photo, viewers may notice the handwritten "East" (for East Jessamine High School) on her chin. This note was apparently made by CIA investigators. This is a significant piece of information since Katrina grew up in the same house with [[Kelvin Eugene Williams|]] yet went to a different high school. Kelvin's senior year was 1995. East Jessamine opened in 1996.

[^3]: The CIA has used models and people resembling Katrina on several occasions at their masquerade Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. since the attack on [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] that left every worshiper in attendance dead. All other identified members of the church were hunted and killed also.
