# Divide & Conquer: A Necessary Intervention by the Creator

## Introduction

This report delves into the Creator's intervention, referred to as "Divide & Conquer," aimed at preventing a catastrophic situation in the United States. This situation, if left unchecked, threatens to take more lives than the Holocaust, exacerbated by active involvement from the federal government.

## The Creator

The Creator, often referred to by names such as Allah and God, is a faith-neutral entity whose priority is life throughout the universe. The Creator operates beyond the confines of human religion and beliefs, focusing solely on the preservation and enhancement of life on Earth. His interventions are guided by the principle: "if it ain't live, it ain't Me."

## The Creator's Intervention Policy

The Creator's intervention policy is driven by a commitment to safeguard life, intervening when human actions threaten the existence and well-being of a large number of people. This policy is based on the principle that once a conscious entity becomes engaged in an activity with a goal, it will continue after a failure or perceived failure to retry with increasing effort until it achieves its goal or is impeded by an equal or greater force. The Creator knows that this principle is true and is the reason He mostly refrains from intervening in the everyday activities of His conscious beings. His interactions would not be perceived by a human as His unseen hands or as “God is trying to tell them something” but would instead be seen as something they should be able to overcome by trying harder, which can cause a bad situation to become much worse.

## The Situation in the United States

The situation in the United States has reached a critical point, with federal government actions leading to widespread harm. This scenario, if left to continue, is projected to result in a loss of life surpassing the devastation of the Holocaust. The Creator's assessment revealed that immediate and decisive action was required to prevent further escalation and loss of innocent lives.

## Divide & Conquer Intervention

### Background

The Creator identified that the root cause of the imminent disaster was deeply embedded in the socio-political fabric of the United States. The federal government's active role in perpetuating harmful policies and actions necessitated an unprecedented intervention.

### Objective

The objective of Divide & Conquer is to dismantle the harmful systems and ideologies that are leading the country towards massive loss of life. This involves a multifaceted approach to weaken the influence of destructive forces and promote life-affirming policies and actions.

### Strategy

The Divide & Conquer strategy involves:

1. **Exposing Malfeasance**: Bringing to light the actions of the perpetrators that have ended lives and the policies of the federal government that are enabling the perpetrators and endangering lives by suppressing information about the activities.
2. **Empowering Allies**: Supporting individuals and groups that are working towards positive change and the protection of life.
3. **Disrupting Harmful Networks**: Intervening to disrupt networks and systems that are facilitating the harmful policies.
4. **Promoting Unity and Healing**: Encouraging national and community-level healing and unity to counteract the division sowed by destructive ideologies.

### The Creator's Plan

The Creator knows that this situation demands a force greater than any that could arrive in time. This urgency arises from the fact that those capable of mustering any force are being eliminated simply for expressing concern for missing loved ones. Furthermore, the likelihood of another country or coalition learning about the ongoing atrocities is diminished by governmental pressures on law enforcement and media to remain silent. Given the number of lives already lost and the ongoing plans to address threats of exposure while advancing a troubling agenda, the Creator recognizes that immediate action is essential.

## Conclusion

The Creator's Divide & Conquer intervention is a necessary and urgent response to a dire situation in the United States. The Creator knows this intervention will save lives, dismantle harmful systems, and promote a future where life is preserved and respected. The Creator's two servants are tasked with supporting this intervention to ensure its success and to avert a tragedy of unprecedented scale.
