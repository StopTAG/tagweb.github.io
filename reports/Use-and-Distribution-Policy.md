# Policy for Use and Distribution of Content

## This Policy Simplified
All content is for use within the Creation (most commonly called the universe). It can be freely accessed, read, and shared by anyone in the Creation without changes, as long as they credit "the Creator and His two servants."

## Purpose
Content generated by the Creator's servants may contain information provided by the Creator or observed by His servants, which may be classified, secret, or confidential. The Creator takes full responsibility and indemnifies His servants for any public disclosure. This policy outlines guidelines for the production, use, access, and dissemination of content within the Creation, commonly referred to as "the universe."

## Scope
This policy applies to all content placed in a public GitHub repository by the Creator's servants and to all entities, including individuals and organizations, within the Creation that may read, utilize, or redistribute such content.

## Definitions
- **The Creator:** The Creator is an omnipotent and omniscient entity revered across various cultures and beliefs worldwide. Known by multiple names including Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic traditions, the Creator transcends religious affiliations and is acknowledged for divine attributes such as omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence.
- **His Servants:** His servants are the two entities who serve directly under the Creator, with their primary role being to foster and protect His Creation. They are responsible for carrying out the Creator's will, observing and recording the state of the Creation, and disseminating information as directed by the Creator. They ensure that the Creator's intentions and directives are fulfilled.
- **Authorized Party:** Any conscious entity within the universe, or within the Creation.
- **Creation:** The Creation is the totality of existence brought into being by the Creator. It encompasses all forms of life, consciousness, planets, stars, and the entirety of the universe. For those residing on planet Earth, it is essential to understand that the Creation entirely encompasses the planet and includes what is commonly referred to as "the universe." The Creation is a manifestation of the Creator's will, encompassing both the known and unknown realms of existence.
